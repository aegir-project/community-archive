</ul></div><div id='diff-inline-2755'><p>The Aegir team is pleased to announce the third release candidate for the upcoming Aegir 2.0 release.</p>

<p>This release mainly fixes a couple critical bugs in 2.0-rc2 that were causing problems when sites were being cloned or renamed. We've added a couple small features, such as additional options during hostmaster-install, and allowing the redirect to the Welcome page to be turned off. Also, we've made a small addition to the API, in that there is now a hook available (<code>hook_provision_drupal_create_directories_alter()</code>) to allow altering the directories created when a site installed.</p>

<p>In order to better support PHP 5.4, we have added a patch to Drupal core to suppress E_STRICT warnings. These were harmless, but annoying. They were caused by a changed in PHP error-reporting in PHP 5.4, and the Views module's maintainers' desire to remain backward compatible with PHP 4. For more details, see: <a href="http://drupal.org/node/2060727">#2060727: Patch Drupal core to suppress E_STRICT warnings on PHP5.4.</a></p>

<p>A number of pending issues require a new stable release of Drush (5.10), so we will work with the maintainers to help get a new release out.</p>

<h1>Known issues</h1>

<p>Our release process is still done by hand instead of being more automated because we can't use our aegir distribution as core (<a href="https://drupal.org/node/1991764">issue #1991764</a>).</p>

<p><a href="https://drupal.org/node/1931000">Issue #1931000: Missing drush backend output in frontend log</a> has been fixed, but may require a <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2025527#comment-7566747">patch to Drush</a> for the use of hosting-queued.</p>

<p>Subdirectory support is still very preliminary and needs a number of issues to be fixed before completion, see <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2046167">#2046167</a> for details. Note that this will not block a stable release, since this feature is 'experimental', and additional re-factoring can occur during the stable release cycle.</p>
