14:56       mig5@&gt; shall we do a scrum darthsteven anarcat ergonlogic omega8cc
15:02    anarcat@&gt; oh yes!
15:02    anarcat@&gt; scrum time!
15:03   omega8cc+&gt; hi!
15:03    hefring &gt; privet
15:03    anarcat@&gt; alright
15:04    anarcat@&gt; well, for myself i am just back from vacation
15:04    anarcat@&gt; still swamped with a lot of non-aegir related work
15:04    anarcat@&gt; but hopefully i will get to fix some pesky issues that have been bothering our clients and workers here
15:05    anarcat@&gt; one low hanging fruit we have is to deploy those module automatically on new sites: <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1157114" title="http://drupal.org/node/1157114">http://drupal.org/node/1157114</a>
15:05    hefring &gt; <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1157114" title="http://drupal.org/node/1157114">http://drupal.org/node/1157114</a> =&gt; DB Login =&gt; 0 comments, 1 IRC mention
15:06 (*)  anarcat looking for the second one
15:06    anarcat@&gt; <a href="http://drupal.org/project/environment_indicator" title="http://drupal.org/project/environment_indicator">http://drupal.org/project/environment_indicator</a>
15:06    anarcat@&gt; there
15:06    anarcat@&gt; the other things are: exportable backups and the pesky files directory
15:06    anarcat@&gt; i am looking for ways to optimise the migrations
15:06    anarcat@&gt; because right now we end up tarring and untarring a lot of the same crap every week
15:07    anarcat@&gt; and i'm looking for ways to optimise that
15:07    anarcat@&gt; so suggestions welcome there
15:07    anarcat@&gt; the exportable backups is just to have a way to hardlink the backup in the @hostmaster/files directory with a hard-to-guess filename so that only the user can download it
15:11       mig5@&gt; interesting
15:11       mig5@&gt; sorry, dealing with a nagios alert here at the same time
15:11    anarcat@&gt; fun :)
15:11    anarcat@&gt; i think that's pretty much it for me
15:12       mig5@&gt; not much from me this week.. need to find some more time to look at <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1388906" title="http://drupal.org/node/1388906">http://drupal.org/node/1388906</a> again. would be nice to test the nginx stuff more, not that we don't trust omega8cc of course :)
15:12    hefring &gt; <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1388906" title="http://drupal.org/node/1388906">http://drupal.org/node/1388906</a> =&gt; It is possible to break Nginx based install with upload progress by enabling nginx_ssl feature =&gt; Provision, Code, critical, needs review, 5 comments, 1 IRC mention
15:12       mig5@&gt; i'm otherwise just swamped with work, it's insane
15:12    anarcat@&gt; i know how you feel
15:12    anarcat@&gt; my return from vacation is insane
15:12       mig5@&gt; i give my aegir talk at Druapl DownUnder on saturday, should be good
15:12       mig5@&gt; how was NYC ?
15:12    anarcat@&gt; we had a compromised ftp account that sent out 30k spams on my first day :P
15:12       mig5@&gt; ugh!
15:12    anarcat@&gt; it was good
15:12    anarcat@&gt; it was only one day!
15:12    anarcat@&gt; but i did a aegir pres with ergonlogic
15:12    anarcat@&gt; and i think we got a few people in
15:13    anarcat@&gt; i met with the pantheon guys, and they have a *great* product
15:13    anarcat@&gt; not open source of course :P
15:13       mig5@&gt; yeah. it's nice and simple
15:13    anarcat@&gt; but they really got somethign going with their dev/staging/prod thingy
15:13       mig5@&gt; yes and non-free :(
15:13 ergonlogic &gt; hi
15:13    anarcat@&gt; well, i got invite codes
15:13    anarcat@&gt; i promised josh_k_ i would try to crack their thing
15:13       mig5@&gt; haha
15:13    anarcat@&gt; so far didn't find the time
15:13    anarcat@&gt; but they really have good security tools
15:14    anarcat@&gt; they are using cgroups, fcgi (or similar)
15:14       mig5@&gt; David Strauss knows his stuff
15:14    anarcat@&gt; so basically, you are renting out process groups
15:14       mig5@&gt; and that valhalla filesystem he's using for clustering and HA, sounds interesting
15:14    anarcat@&gt; as opposed to whole vservers, which was the old way
15:14    anarcat@&gt; yeah that's nice too
15:14       mig5@&gt; what are they using underneath: debian?
15:14       mig5@&gt; or redhat?
15:14    anarcat@&gt; i didn't troll, so i don't know ;)
15:14       mig5@&gt; i seem to recall a redhat feature that rented processes
15:15    anarcat@&gt; well, cgroups allow for fine-grained process isolation
15:15    anarcat@&gt; cgroups is the kernel option that allows vservers (or linux containers as the call them now) to work
15:15       mig5@&gt; yeh
15:15    anarcat@&gt; they also use selinux
15:15    anarcat@&gt; they seem really into it
15:15    anarcat@&gt; pretty cool
15:15    anarcat@&gt; anyways
15:15       mig5@&gt; i'm surprised they don't just build a machine per client or something.. it's not that expensive these days
15:15    anarcat@&gt; enough with pantheon :P
15:15       mig5@&gt; yeah :)
15:15    anarcat@&gt; mig5: that's what they were doing before
15:16    anarcat@&gt; i think it was *more* expensive than clustering in a single box
15:16    anarcat@&gt; you got to get some edge in some place
15:16    anarcat@&gt; so anyways
15:16    anarcat@&gt; ergonlogic hi!
15:16    anarcat@&gt; ergonlogic: something to add to our first scrum of the year?
15:16    anarcat@&gt; (or is it?)
15:16    anarcat@&gt; :)
15:16 ergonlogic &gt; well, I'm just back from vacation too
15:16    anarcat@&gt; welcome back :)
15:17 ergonlogic &gt; so trying to get back into the swing of things
15:17 ergonlogic &gt; I'm working out the kinks to start doing to Aegir 101 screencasts
15:17 ergonlogic &gt; s/to/some/g
15:17 ergonlogic &gt; and fighting with vimeo... they don;t like .ogv apparently
15:18    anarcat@&gt; them basterds :)
15:18 ergonlogic &gt; but anyway, just "how to create a site with Aegir" kinda stuff
15:18 ergonlogic &gt; introductory for new clients, at this point
15:19 ergonlogic &gt; other than that, just before the holidays, anarcat and I published a couple puppet modules
15:19 ergonlogic &gt; one for drush and another for aegir
15:19 ergonlogic &gt; on d.o
15:19    anarcat@&gt; oh yeah we did!
15:19    anarcat@&gt; actually *you* did :)
15:19 ergonlogic &gt; well, I published them, sure...
15:19    anarcat@&gt; but yeah, we polished a aegir module
15:19 ergonlogic &gt; but *we* worked on getting them publishable
15:19    anarcat@&gt; unfortunately it still relies on debian
15:19    anarcat@&gt; ie. it doesn't do the manual install if you're *not* on debian
15:19       mig5@&gt; oh, exciting! where are the modules?
15:19    anarcat@&gt; which would have been awesome
15:20 ergonlogic &gt; I posted a dozen or so issues on them for cleanup 
15:20    anarcat@&gt; well, it *should* be on <a href="../../../contrib-modules/index.html" title="http://community.aegirproject.org/contrib-modules">http://community.aegirproject.org/contrib-modules</a>
15:20    anarcat@&gt; but it isn't :P
15:20       mig5@&gt; i'll work this into a new aegir newsletter :)
15:20 ergonlogic &gt; I'll get the urls
15:20    anarcat@&gt; and i'll add them to the page
15:20 ergonlogic &gt; <a href="http://drupal.org/project/puppet-aegir" title="http://drupal.org/project/puppet-aegir">http://drupal.org/project/puppet-aegir</a>
15:20 ergonlogic &gt; <a href="http://drupal.org/project/puppet-drush" title="http://drupal.org/project/puppet-drush">http://drupal.org/project/puppet-drush</a>
15:21       mig5@&gt; i love this: server goes down, hosting company's support system and all their nameservers go down as well. excellent
15:21       mig5@&gt; if it wasn't for DNS cache they'd be uncontactable to tell them about it
15:21 (*)  anarcat notices the twitter block on c.a.o is still broken
15:21 ergonlogic &gt; they depend on a couple other puppet modules, one from Koumbit, and another from RiseUp, which is documented on the project pages
15:21    anarcat@&gt; mig5: dns -&gt; ouch
15:21 ergonlogic &gt; sigh...
15:21       mig5@&gt; great stuff re: puppet
15:22       mig5@&gt; looking forward to trying that
15:22 ergonlogic &gt; anyway, I also updated Aegir Up to use the new puppet modules
15:22 ergonlogic &gt; <a href="http://drupal.org/project/aegir-up" title="http://drupal.org/project/aegir-up">http://drupal.org/project/aegir-up</a>
15:22 ergonlogic &gt; using git subtrees
15:22    anarcat@&gt; mig5: another thing for your newsletter: arch linux support! <a href="../../../node/389/revisions/view/2683/2684/index.html" title="http://community.aegirproject.org/node/389/revisions/view/2683/2684">http://community.aegirproject.org/node/389/revisions/view/2683/2684</a>
15:23       mig5@&gt; yes! saw that
15:23 ergonlogic &gt; so I now have about a dozen branches to wrangle
15:23       mig5@&gt; and did you see darthsteven's crazy article where he mass-migrated sites between two aegirs
15:23 ergonlogic &gt; but seems more maintainable than sub-modules
15:23 ergonlogic &gt; indeed yes!
15:23 ergonlogic &gt; I want to try it out this week or next
15:24 ergonlogic &gt; the mass migration stuff looks very cool
15:24 ergonlogic &gt; it's also the initial reason I started aegir-up, to test that sort of thing
15:25    anarcat@&gt; <a href="../../../contrib-modules/index.html#Puppet_modules" title="http://community.aegirproject.org/contrib-modules#Puppet_modules">http://community.aegirproject.org/contrib-modules#Puppet_modules</a>
15:25 ergonlogic &gt; anarcat: thanks!
15:26 ergonlogic &gt; I think that's it from me...
15:26    anarcat@&gt; ok, i think we're done then
15:27   omega8cc+&gt; I'm also back at work and plan to port some never submitted patches to 1.x, as we (boa) are using already 2.x code so it was a bit out of sync between boa and official Nginx support in Aegir 1.x
15:27 ergonlogic &gt; I'd really appreciate some feedback on Aegir-up, btw
15:27    anarcat@&gt; unless darthsteven magically flys in
15:27    anarcat@&gt; with his cape
15:27    anarcat@&gt; oh, omega8cc ! hi! :)
15:27   omega8cc+&gt; plus, I promised to submit standalone Aegir on Nginx how-to (step by step). We also tested and helped to fix a few distros so they work with Aegir and this list grows nicely :)
15:27   omega8cc+&gt; hi anarcat! and all
15:27    anarcat@&gt; nice!
15:27    anarcat@&gt; omega8cc: any work on a debian package for nginx? :)
15:28   omega8cc+&gt; anarcat: there is chance it will be soon! on the table already
15:28   omega8cc+&gt; as we are moving with everything to things like deb, puppet etc
15:28 darthsteve@&gt; Sorry I missed the scrum!
15:28    anarcat@&gt; nice!
15:28 darthsteve@&gt; In another meeting
15:28    anarcat@&gt; i am really happy to hear that!
15:29    anarcat@&gt; omega8cc: if you need help with the package, i already have ideas on how to do it
15:29 darthsteve@&gt; Nothing really to add though
15:29 ergonlogic &gt; omega8cc: I'd be happy to integrate nginx patches to the puppet-aegir module :)
15:29 ergonlogic &gt; hi steve
15:29    anarcat@&gt; omega8cc: basically, i think that it can be done without creating a new package - just add "| nginx" as a dependency and make a debconf dialog (or autodetection) to figure out which to setup
15:29 ergonlogic &gt; steven
15:29   omega8cc+&gt; anarcat: I will ask for your assistance for sure, thanks!
15:29 darthsteve@&gt; Hoping to get back to working on Aegir within the next few weeks.
15:29 darthsteve@&gt; Sorry for interrupting!
15:30   omega8cc+&gt; anarcat: exactly, it shouldn't be a separate package
15:30 ergonlogic &gt; darthsteven: thanks for the mass migration write-up
15:30    anarcat@&gt; cool
15:30 ergonlogic &gt; darthsteven: I'll be trying it out soon
15:30   omega8cc+&gt; ergonlogic: sure, I will let you know
15:31 darthsteve@&gt; ergonlogic: Yeah, no doubt I removed a vital part of it while writing it up. Pester me of that's the case
15:31 ergonlogic &gt; darthsteven: you can bet on it ;)
15:32 darthsteve@&gt; Some of it will be in Aegir core at some point, so I'd rather find the bugs now :)
15:33   omega8cc+&gt; darthsteven: hi, in the meantime we (boa) are testing the 2.x code in production :)
15:34   omega8cc+&gt; so far, absolutely no issues
15:34 darthsteve@&gt; omega8cc: Hehe, just you wait...
15:35   omega8cc+&gt; ;)
15:35 darthsteve@&gt; omega8cc: Though hopefully we can get some more tests written
15:40 ergonlogic &gt; ok then... so, I'll assume that's the end of the scrum and post the log to c.a.o
15:40       mig5@&gt; thanks ergonlogic
