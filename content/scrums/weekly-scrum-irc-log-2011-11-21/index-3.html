07:00 &lt;@mig5&gt; ok, time for a quick scrum
07:00 &lt;@mig5&gt; good morning
07:00 &lt;@mig5&gt; it appears darthsteven sends his apologies!
07:00 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; Nothing from me, will do a 1.6 release tomorrow if I have time!
07:00 &lt;@mig5&gt; so ping anarcat, ergonlogic, etc
07:00 &lt;@mig5&gt; oh he's here! :)
07:00 &lt;@mig5&gt; cool
07:00 &lt;@mig5&gt; thanks darthsteven 
07:00 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; Now I'm gone...
07:01 &lt;@mig5&gt; not much from me this week: I posted the first of a fortnightly Aegir newsletter last wednesday, I got some good feedback from anarcat but that was 
              about it :)
07:01 &lt;@mig5&gt; ok. 1.6 release will be tomorrow
07:01 &lt;@mig5&gt; my stickers have arrived, i ordered way too many for DrupalDownUnder, maybe I'll send some in the post to people :)
07:02 &lt;@mig5&gt; we fixed the Reset Password bug that broke resetting of passwords in Drupal 5, so that will go into the 1.6 release which is nice
07:02 &lt;@mig5&gt; that's all from me I think. anarcat?
07:03 &lt; teeyza&gt; so anyone have any ideas why my aegir wont upgrade?
07:03 &lt;@mig5&gt; right, i have a feeling anarcat isn't here, and we have a hijacker, so I might end the scrum earlier than usual..
07:03 &lt;@mig5&gt; thanks all
07:14 &lt;@anarcat&gt; oops
07:14 &lt;@anarcat&gt; missed the scrum
07:14 &lt;+ergonlogic&gt; sorry
07:14 &lt;@anarcat&gt; mig5 / darthsteven : pong
07:14 &lt;@mig5&gt; hehe
07:14 &lt;@anarcat&gt; we were in our own planning session over here, maybe we can touchbase on that
07:14 &lt;@mig5&gt; sure thing
07:15 &lt;@anarcat&gt; we are reorienting my work a bit, away from <a href="../../../discuss/back-vacation/index.html" title="http://community.aegirproject.org/discuss/back-vacation">http://community.aegirproject.org/discuss/back-vacation</a>
07:15 &lt; teeyza&gt; my apologies mig i was corrected, so were stuck on step 4 of the that link
07:15 &lt;@anarcat&gt; we'll focus on the debian packaging and puppet manifests
07:15 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i'm going to work on a provision-upgrade command which will be basically like drush upgrade
07:15 &lt;@anarcat&gt; but really safe
07:15 &lt;@anarcat&gt; and designed specifically with the upgrade of aegir itself in mind
07:16 &lt;@anarcat&gt; so that we can ship the files with the aegir-hostmaster package
07:16 &lt;@anarcat&gt; and overwrite existing files, and run the update and so on
07:16 &lt;@anarcat&gt; we're also going to work on D7 LDAP integration so that Drupal can be used to manage LDAP groups and user memberships
07:16 &lt;@mig5&gt; will that open itself up to <a href="http://drupal.org/node/711746" title="http://drupal.org/node/711746">http://drupal.org/node/711746</a> in any way?
07:16 &lt; hefring&gt; <a href="http://drupal.org/node/711746" title="http://drupal.org/node/711746">http://drupal.org/node/711746</a> =&gt; allow upgrade of hostmaster sites from the frontend =&gt; Hosting, Code, minor, postponed, 3 comments, 1 IRC mention
07:16 &lt;@anarcat&gt; which is a bit offtopic here
07:16 &lt;@anarcat&gt; mig5: i don't know
07:16 &lt;@anarcat&gt; maybe
07:17 &lt;@mig5&gt; we need that external queue daemon :)
07:17 &lt;@anarcat&gt; so those are our priorities, shifting the other ones in the list down
07:17 &lt;@anarcat&gt; yes
07:17 &lt;@anarcat&gt; so that's still in the list
07:17 &lt;@anarcat&gt; but probably after christmas if not summer
07:17 &lt;@mig5&gt; sure
07:17 &lt;@anarcat&gt; same with unit tests, which get pushed away
07:17 &lt;@anarcat&gt; we're going to also sponsor more uc_hosting and hosting_services development
07:18 &lt;@anarcat&gt; with sfyn waiting to do a lot of improvements there, apparently
07:18 &lt;@anarcat&gt; expect the "official puppet module for aegir" to come out soon
07:18 &lt;@anarcat&gt; oh
07:18 &lt;@mig5&gt; awesome! :) 
07:18 &lt;@anarcat&gt; and just random name-dropping here: openstack.
07:18 &lt;@anarcat&gt; that's it for me.
07:18 &lt;@mig5&gt; thanks anarcat
07:18 &lt;+sfyn&gt; 3~hey folks
07:19 &lt;+sfyn&gt; guess its scrum time
07:19 &lt;@mig5&gt; hey sfyn 
07:19 &lt;+ergonlogic&gt; for my part, I'll be helping with the aegir puppet module
07:19 &lt;+ergonlogic&gt; yeah... a little late
07:19 &lt; teeyza&gt; hey mig, you have any other suggestions i could try?
07:19 &lt;@anarcat&gt; sfyn: it *was* :)
07:19 &lt;@mig5&gt; teeyza: please wait a bit, we are in the middle of a regular meeting
07:19 &lt;+ergonlogic&gt; and otherwise continuing to push aegir-up towards a release
07:19 &lt;+sfyn&gt; oops
07:19 &lt; teeyza&gt; kk
07:19 &lt;@anarcat&gt; sfyn: we had a great discussion on prioritizing work for aegir in the following week here
07:19 -!- mode/#aegir [+m] by anarcat
07:20 -!- mode/#aegir [+v mig5] by anarcat
07:20 -!- mode/#aegir [+v darthsteven] by anarcat, anarcat
07:20 &lt;@mig5&gt; thanks..
07:20 &lt;+ergonlogic&gt; that's most of it for me
07:20 &lt;+sfyn&gt; short term my efforts are more on civicrm support right now
07:20 &lt;@anarcat&gt; sfyn: we'll be looking from feedback from you about estimates on how much time we should spend on hostnig_services integration this year
07:20 &lt;@mig5&gt; i'm very interested in the aegir puppet stuff, i use vagrant for dev now, let me know if you need extra eyes on that :)
07:20 &lt;@anarcat&gt; mig5: we certainly will!
07:20 &lt;+ergonlogic&gt; mig5: indeed, yes!
07:21 &lt;@mig5&gt; and i know puppet pretty well these days
07:21 &lt;@anarcat&gt; now that's cool
07:21 &lt;+sfyn&gt; anarcat: hosting_services is a mess right now
07:21 &lt;@anarcat&gt; sfyn: and yes, maybe we need to add provision_civi to our shopping list, if it's not budgeted in other teams
07:21 &lt;@mig5&gt; although ergonlogic taught me you can preseed directly in puppet, didn't know that :)
07:21 &lt;+ergonlogic&gt; :)
07:21 &lt;@anarcat&gt; sfyn: how much hours does that mean, "mess"? ;)
07:22 &lt;+sfyn&gt; anarcat: means i don't know
07:22 &lt;@anarcat&gt; sfyn: awesome
07:22 &lt;@anarcat&gt; sfyn: i've put a mostly random guess of 100h
07:22 &lt;@anarcat&gt; maybe we can try to fine-grain the thing in smaller iterations
07:22 &lt;@anarcat&gt; and do a better estimate
07:22 &lt;@anarcat&gt; but we don't need to do it now :)
07:22 &lt;@anarcat&gt; just a heads up that we'd like to push this out
07:22 &lt;@anarcat&gt; for the next reflexion meeting
07:22 &lt;+sfyn&gt; anarcat: ok
07:23 &lt;@anarcat&gt; alright, i think that's it for our part of the scrum, unless sfyn or ergonlogic have anything to add
07:23 &lt;+sfyn&gt; anarcat: I will break down the work for both projects over the week
07:23 &lt;@anarcat&gt; sfyn: awesome
07:23 -!- mode/#aegir [-m] by anarcat
07:23 &lt;@mig5&gt; thanks guys
07:23 &lt;+ergonlogic&gt; no, I'm done
07:23 &lt;@anarcat&gt; sorry for the censorship here :)
07:23 &lt;+sfyn&gt; thats it for me
07:23 &lt;@anarcat&gt; thanks\
