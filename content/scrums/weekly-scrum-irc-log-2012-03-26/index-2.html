I would suggest that we should release 1.8 soonish. I also did some work on aegir-up to make it super useful for developing aegir itself.<br />[07:03:09]&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;mig5&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i am OK for it to be rescheduled - however, if it moves earlier in the day, i won&#039;t be showing up :)<br />[07:03:14]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;mig5&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and i think that&#039;s ok, to be honest...<br />[07:03:25]&nbsp; &lt;mig5&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we&#039;ve spent years to trying to accomodate for everyone and i think it&#039;s the wrong approach<br />[07:03:44] &lt;mig5&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i&#039;ll send updates via hefring in advance, and read scrum notes afterward<br />[07:03:45]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;ergonlogic&gt;&nbsp; mig5: ok<br />[07:03:54] &lt;ergonlogic&gt;&nbsp; mig5: do you have a suggestion?<br />[07:04:09]&nbsp; &lt;ergonlogic&gt;&nbsp; nobody wants to exclude anyone else<br />[07:04:14]&nbsp; &lt;mig5&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nope. any later is too late for the europeans<br />[07:04:24]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;mig5&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any earlier, i will not wake up (hard enough already :) )<br />[07:04:42]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;mig5&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and by the time the europeans are getting up, it&#039;s late for me, so same problem<br />[07:04:56] &lt;mig5&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reversed<br />[07:04:59] &lt;ergonlogic&gt;&nbsp; yep<br />[07:05:06]&nbsp; &lt;ergonlogic&gt;&nbsp; no wins<br />[07:05:22]&nbsp; &lt;omega8cc&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mig5: hah, hefring could help a bit, but it is then not really interactive :) 22pm cet is still ok for me<br />[07:05:56]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;mig5&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i&#039;m not fussed on &#039;exclusion&#039;, it&#039;s simply the nature of things :) i&#039;d sooner see four or 5 of you talking, via logs, than three of us<br />[07:06:35]&nbsp; &lt;mig5&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nothing new from me anyway this week - darthsteven has been amazing in the issue queues, fixed a lot of things. and it looks like i need to finally check out aegir-up<br />[07:06:59]&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;omega8cc&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or maybe let&#039;s schedule two scrums on Monday/Tuesday then? so we could choose which scrum to attend?<br />[07:07:02]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;ergonlogic&gt;&nbsp; well, we do alot of communicating outside the scrums, so I don;t think it&#039;s essential<br />[07:07:22]&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;ergonlogic&gt;&nbsp; omega8cc: that&#039;s another good idea<br />[07:07:35]&nbsp; &lt;mig5&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yes a morning/night scrum could be interesting :)<br />[07:07:47]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;ergonlogic&gt;&nbsp; though maybe monday/thursday, or something<br />[07:07:54]&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;ergonlogic&gt;&nbsp; so it&#039;s spread out a bit more?<br />[07:08:02]&nbsp; &lt;omega8cc&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sometimes I work late in the night cet<br />[07:08:03]&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;mig5&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yep<br />[07:08:05]&nbsp; &lt;omega8cc&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; good idea<br />[07:08:20]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;ergonlogic&gt;&nbsp; yeah, same here (late nights)<br />[07:09:11]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;omega8cc&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so let&#039;s convert the old problem into this new idea<br />[07:09:35] &lt;ergonlogic&gt;&nbsp; so, monday afternoons, one hour earlier<br />[07:09:48]&nbsp; &lt;ergonlogic&gt;&nbsp; and thursdays when it&#039;s convenient for mig5?<br />[07:10:31]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;ergonlogic&gt;&nbsp; later, we could perhaps schedule the monday ones earlier to be easier on the europeans...<br />[07:10:44]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;omega8cc&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sure, is thursday ok for you mig5?<br />[07:10:48]&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;mig5&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i&#039;m confused on when is &#039;monday afternoon&#039; - afternoon for who?<br />[07:10:57]&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;ergonlogic&gt;&nbsp; re aegir-up, I&#039;min the process of turning it into a drush extension<br />[07:11:00] &lt;mig5&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thursday is fine for me - at <em>this</em> time, or the other end of the day?<br />[07:11:16]&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;ergonlogic&gt;&nbsp; mig5: well, for me, obviously :P<br />[07:12:06] &lt;omega8cc&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mig5: be the host of the thursday scrum and choose the hour :)<br />[07:12:21]&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;ergonlogic&gt;&nbsp; mig5: I meant one hour earlier than current time on mondays (for now)<br />[07:12:30]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;ergonlogic&gt;&nbsp; for the Monday scrums<br />[07:12:56]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;mig5&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yes, go one hour earlier on the mondays - as i&#039;ll likely just drop out of those, so make it convenient for you<br />[07:13:12]&nbsp; &lt;ergonlogic&gt;&nbsp; right<br />[07:14:27]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;mig5&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and perhaps we go the opposite for Thursday<br />[07:14:27]&nbsp; &lt;mig5&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meetingdetails.html?year=2012&amp;mont...<br />[07:14:47]&nbsp; &lt;mig5&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so it&#039;s the time in montreal for oyu that is for me right now, but europeans and asia-pacific can join in<br />[07:15:36]&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;mig5&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or perhaps one hour earlier, same as you&#039;re going to make it for monday<br />[07:15:49] &lt;mig5&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meetingdetails.html?year=2012&amp;mont...<br />[07:16:18]&nbsp; &lt;omega8cc&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this will work for me, but maybe 9pm would be better<br />[07:16:21] &lt;omega8cc&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; right<br />[07:16:55]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;mig5&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ok sure<br />[07:17:17]&nbsp; &lt;ergonlogic&gt;&nbsp; alright, I&#039;ve update the monday scrums on c.a.o<br />[07:17:38] &lt;ergonlogic&gt;&nbsp; I&#039;ll leave it to one of you to add the second scrum time?<br />[07:17:57]&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;omega8cc&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mig5: :)<br />[07:18:18] &lt;ergonlogic&gt;&nbsp; I guess we can just remove &#039;weekly&#039; from those pages now :)<br />[07:18:29]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;omega8cc&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yep<br />[07:20:00]&nbsp; &lt;ergonlogic&gt;&nbsp; hefring tell darthsteven we&#039;re moving the Monday scrums up by 1 hour (for now) as per anarcat&#039;s request, and starting a second one on Thursdays, to accomodate Mig5 and Omega8cc<br />[07:20:00]&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;hefring&gt; ergonlogic: I&#039;ll pass that on when darthsteven is around.<br />[07:20:20]&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;ergonlogic&gt;&nbsp; hefring tell anarcat we&#039;re moving the Monday scrums up by 1 hour (for now) as per your request, and starting a second one on Thursdays, to accomodate Mig5 and Omega8cc<br />[07:20:20] &lt;hefring&gt; ergonlogic: I&#039;ll pass that on when anarcat is around.<br />[07:21:02]&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;omega8cc&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I still need to take a look at this aegir-up stuff, but am I correct you are rewriting it as a drush ext?<br />[07:21:10]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;ergonlogic&gt;&nbsp; k, so, let&#039;s wrap this up, unless anyone had anything substantive?<br />[07:21:14]&nbsp; &lt;ergonlogic&gt;&nbsp; omega8cc: yep<br />[07:21:27]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;omega8cc&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; awesome!<br />[07:21:27] &lt;ergonlogic&gt;&nbsp; the basics are in place<br />[07:21:39]&nbsp; &lt;ergonlogic&gt;&nbsp; with drush wrappers around the shell scripts I&#039;d written<br />[07:21:57]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;ergonlogic&gt;&nbsp; but I&#039;ll start new commands natively in drush, and port the rest as time permits<br />[07:22:31]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;ergonlogic&gt;&nbsp; hefring: log pointer<br />[07:22:31] &lt;hefring&gt; http://hefring.mig5.net/bot/log/aegir/2012-03-26#T187514<br />[07:22:39] &lt;omega8cc&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have very little to report this week, basically a bit of simple magic in Aegir and Drush 4.6-dev to make it work with Drupal 8<br />[07:22:53] &lt;ergonlogic&gt;&nbsp; omega8cc: yeah, that was nice!<br />[07:23:17]&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;ergonlogic&gt;&nbsp; I haven&#039;t tried it out yet, but nice to see!<br />[07:23:42]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;omega8cc&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that was not really a magic, rather boring search/replace, but still, it is nice it works<br />[07:24:01]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;ergonlogic&gt;&nbsp; drush 5 was released<br />[07:24:33] &lt;ergonlogic&gt;&nbsp; so we might want to start moving aegir to it<br />[07:24:43] &lt;omega8cc&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yeah, but it drops drupal 5 support and we are not compatible yet, afaik<br />[07:24:58] &lt;ergonlogic&gt;&nbsp; there are a couple issues about it, yeah<br />[07:25:04] &lt;omega8cc&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so we have a choice in the meantime<br />[07:25:36]&nbsp; &lt;ergonlogic&gt;&nbsp; well, I guess that can be one of the differentiators for 2.x? no more D5?<br />[07:27:07]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;omega8cc&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yeah, however we have still people on pressflow 5, but it will be a good selling point to give them EOL for d5 support in Aegir<br />[07:27:31]&nbsp; &lt;ergonlogic&gt;&nbsp; drush also supports COMMANDFILE.drush4.inc, or something similar<br />[07:28:08] &lt;ergonlogic&gt;&nbsp; so we could keep our current functionality for backward compatibility<br />[07:28:16]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;omega8cc&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; didn&#039;t know that, nice<br />[07:28:19]&nbsp; &lt;ergonlogic&gt;&nbsp; but it would mean alot more code to maintain<br />[07:28:38] &lt;omega8cc&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yeah, not worth the effort probably<br />[07:29:04]&nbsp; &lt;ergonlogic&gt;&nbsp; it&#039;s an option, if we want to deprecate D5 support, I guess<br />[07:29:59] &lt;ergonlogic&gt;&nbsp; either way drush 5 is the future, and allows for some nifty things<br />[07:30:02]&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;ergonlogic&gt;&nbsp; anyway<br />[07:30:12]&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;ergonlogic&gt;&nbsp; I&#039;ll post the log</code></div></p></div>    </div>
