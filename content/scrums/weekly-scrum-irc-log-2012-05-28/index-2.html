[05:02:37]  &lt;@darthsteven&gt;  anarcat, mig5, omega8cc, EclipseGc, mvc, sfyn, shrop, skwashd: scrum?
[05:02:43]  &lt;@anarcat&gt;  yay
[05:03:49]  &lt;@darthsteven&gt;  shall I go first?
[05:03:55]  &lt;@darthsteven&gt;  I've done not a lot
[05:03:58]  &lt;@shrop&gt;    Not at my computer, but will watch from mobile. Cheers!
[05:04:09]  &lt;@darthsteven&gt;  released 1.9 a little while ago
[05:04:23]  &lt;@anarcat&gt;  upgrade went through like a breeze here
[05:04:24]  &lt;@darthsteven&gt;  that's it from me!
[05:04:30]  &lt;@anarcat&gt;  alright
[05:04:31]  &lt;@darthsteven&gt;  next!
[05:04:43]  &lt;@anarcat&gt;  well, for me, thanks to omega8cc's grant, i have been able to free up more time for the project
[05:04:53]  &lt;@anarcat&gt;  my first focus was on urgent drush security issues
[05:05:07]  &lt;@anarcat&gt;  <a href="http://drupal.org/node/671906" title="http://drupal.org/node/671906">http://drupal.org/node/671906</a>
[05:05:09]  &lt;@hefring&gt;  <a href="http://drupal.org/node/671906" title="http://drupal.org/node/671906">http://drupal.org/node/671906</a> =&gt; mysql credentials leak in drush sqlc =&gt; Drush, PM (dl, en, up ...), critical, needs review, 44 comments, 3 IRC mentions
[05:05:33]  &lt;@anarcat&gt;  this is mostly fixed, but i have found deep issues in the sql code and other credentials leaks that are not yet fixd
[05:05:44]  &lt;@anarcat&gt;  my progress can be followed here: <a href="http://drupal.org/user/1274/track" title="http://drupal.org/user/1274/track">http://drupal.org/user/1274/track</a>
[05:06:01]  &lt;@anarcat&gt;  and here: <a href="http://drupal.org/user/1274/track/code" title="http://drupal.org/user/1274/track/code">http://drupal.org/user/1274/track/code</a>
[05:06:32]  &lt;@anarcat&gt;  which reminds me: i have started work on a pretty dumb merge script for apache log files
[05:06:35]  &lt;@anarcat&gt;  <a href="http://drupal.org/project/provision-mergelog" title="http://drupal.org/project/provision-mergelog">http://drupal.org/project/provision-mergelog</a>
[05:06:51]  &lt;@anarcat&gt;  it is designed to suck apache logs from remote servers into a single file that can then be parsed by logfile analysis software
[05:07:11]  &lt;@anarcat&gt;  i have done some tests with awstats, and it works well, considering awstats haven't been updated in 3 years
[05:07:17]  &lt;@anarcat&gt;  btw, piwik sucks for that
[05:07:21]  &lt;@darthsteven&gt;  cool!
[05:07:31]  &lt;@anarcat&gt;  while it *can* process those logfiles, it's not reliable at all and makes *ONE HIT PER LINE* on the webserver
[05:07:42]  &lt;@anarcat&gt;  which is a lot of fun if the piwik site is in the logfile itself :P
[05:08:03]  &lt;@anarcat&gt;  i have also dug my head in the SSL code again, and found quite a lot of issues
[05:08:14]  &lt;@anarcat&gt;  found new bugs:
[05:08:15]  &lt;@anarcat&gt;  <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1603722" title="http://drupal.org/node/1603722">http://drupal.org/node/1603722</a>
[05:08:15]  &lt;@hefring&gt;  <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1603722" title="http://drupal.org/node/1603722">http://drupal.org/node/1603722</a> =&gt; deleting a site doesn't delete its SSL certificate =&gt; Hostmaster (Aegir), Code, normal, needs work, 2 comments, 1 IRC mention
[05:08:32]  &lt;@anarcat&gt;  and updated the existing one: <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1126640" title="http://drupal.org/node/1126640">http://drupal.org/node/1126640</a>
[05:08:33]  &lt;@hefring&gt;  <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1126640" title="http://drupal.org/node/1126640">http://drupal.org/node/1126640</a> =&gt; move the SSL IP allocation to the frontend =&gt; Hostmaster (Aegir), Code, normal, needs work, 20 comments, 1 IRC mention
[05:08:40]  &lt;@anarcat&gt;  but we need to redo the SSL code, it's quite crappy right now
[05:08:52]  &lt;@anarcat&gt;  i am not sure we want to ditch IP management, as SNI doesn't seem quite mature enough yet
[05:08:59]  &lt;@anarcat&gt;  so i'd like to support both SNI and non-SNI setups
[05:09:19]  &lt;@anarcat&gt;  alright what else have i done
[05:09:40]  &lt;@anarcat&gt;  well, i guess all is left is what next:
[05:09:51]  &lt;@anarcat&gt;  i will work on improving migrate performance
[05:10:09]  &lt;@anarcat&gt;  <a href="https://drupal.org/node/1484214" title="https://drupal.org/node/1484214">https://drupal.org/node/1484214</a>
[05:10:19]  &lt;@anarcat&gt;  i will attack <a href="https://drupal.org/node/1205458" title="https://drupal.org/node/1205458">https://drupal.org/node/1205458</a> shortly
[05:10:24]  &lt;@anarcat&gt;  and i'm looking for advice on how to do that
[05:10:32]  &lt;@anarcat&gt;  should files reside in the clients directory?
[05:11:00]  &lt;@anarcat&gt;  anyways, that's about it for me
[05:11:14]  &lt;@anarcat&gt;  i am going for a trip in sao paulo brasil between june 5th and 18th
[05:11:26]  &lt;@anarcat&gt;  if people want to hookup or organize a little aegir meetup there, that could be fun and useful
[05:11:32]  &lt;@anarcat&gt;  next up?
[05:12:35]  &lt;@anarcat&gt;  that was quite a monologue
[05:12:52]  &lt;@darthsteven&gt;  (all good stuff though)
[05:13:52]  &lt;@darthsteven&gt;  anyone else?
[05:14:20]  &lt;@omega8cc&gt; not much from me to report, other that we have now nice ssd machine for project testing etc
[05:15:12]  &lt;@darthsteven&gt;  indeed, thanks very much for that!
[05:15:30]  &lt;@anarcat&gt;  cool
[05:15:35]  &lt;@anarcat&gt;  who's following up on that setup?
[05:15:59]  &lt;@darthsteven&gt;  I am
[05:16:07]  &lt;@anarcat&gt;  alright
[05:16:09]  &lt;@anarcat&gt;  that's awesome
[05:16:18]  &lt;@anarcat&gt;  i noticed that ergonlogic posted something about vagrant
[05:16:21]  &lt;@darthsteven&gt;  should be able to get it sorted this week or next
[05:16:25]  &lt;@anarcat&gt;  he showed me his work, it's pretty good
[05:16:26]  &lt;@omega8cc&gt; ah, I have added r1soft backups there, just in case
[05:16:40]  &lt;@darthsteven&gt;  I'm trying to 'do it right' and set it all up using puppet
[05:18:10]  &lt;@anarcat&gt;  that's awesome
[05:19:32]  &lt;@darthsteven&gt;  we'll call that a scrum there
[05:19:34]  &lt;@darthsteven&gt;  oh
[05:20:11]  &lt;@darthsteven&gt;  actually, Drush 5 got itself a bit more sorted, and so Aegir could probably be released for Drush 5 now, if we wanted, but we'll have a better release if we wait a bit
[05:20:25]  &lt;@darthsteven&gt;  but we'll call it a scrum now.
