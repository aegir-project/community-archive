<p>After 17 months of development, we have finally reached that significant milestone in Aegir's development: we have a stable release candidate you can test and hammer on.</p>

<p>Since we have made our first release candidate, we're now on the high road towards the final release. We'll now focus on the issues mentionned in the <a href="../../../../../0/index.html">release notes</a> and reported <a href="http://drupal.org/project/issues?text=&amp;projects=provision%2C+hosting%2C+hostslave%2C+eldir%2C+Hostmaster+%28Aegir%29&amp;status=Open&amp;priorities=1&amp;categories=All">critical bugs</a>.</p>

<p>This also means that 0.4 is now a stable branch. I have just branched off the <code>provision-0.4</code> and <code>hostmaster-0.4</code> branches off the release tag, and new releases on the 0.4 series will be done from that branch.</p>

<p>That also means that commits done on the master branch will <em>not</em> be shipped with next releases unless they are explicitly cherry-picked to the stable branch. This is to ensure maximum stability while allowing for development of new features and crazy things on the <code>master</code> branch. One of the things that is planned to happen there is the <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1060902">Drupal 7 port of the frontend</a> or <a href="http://drupal.org/node/922280">DNS support</a>. I also personally plan to work on enhancing the security model to allow users to run drush commands on their sites directly, without doing funky <code>sudo -u aegir</code> or similar insanities beforehand.</p>

<p>This is all in accordance with our regular <a href="../../../../187/index.html">branch workflow</a> and <a href="../../../../32/index.html">release process</a> for those of you curious about those things. We do hope, however, that the 0.4 branch will be short-lived and that we'll head for the mythical 1.0 release shortly to give you a stable release of new feature in a timely manner (ie. not 17 months :).</p>

<p>Now go test our <a href="../../../../../0/index.html">shiny new release</a> and <a href="../../../../16/index.html">report any issues you may find</a>!</p>    </div>
