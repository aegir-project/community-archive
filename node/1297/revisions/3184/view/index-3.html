[21:01:31]    alright! i actually made it, almost on time, to the second scrum of the week
[21:01:39]    i missed the first few weeks, and i'm meant to be the one hosting it. epic
[21:01:50]    darthsteven: anarcat: ergonlogic: if you're around
[21:02:04]     mig5: hello!
[21:02:37]    i updated the python-cloudfiles installation on the jenkins server, and raised a sleep timeout limit that was causing all our jenkins builds to fail, as rackspace takes ages to build from our images these days sadly
[21:02:55]     cool
[21:03:07]     not cool about rackspace though
[21:03:11]    i then suckered myself into working more on what was meant to be a trivial patch, and now has left me bewildered and confused <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1503824" title="http://drupal.org/node/1503824">http://drupal.org/node/1503824</a>
[21:03:12]     <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1503824" title="http://drupal.org/node/1503824">http://drupal.org/node/1503824</a> =&gt; hosting_site_count() ignores disabled sites =&gt; Hostmaster (Aegir), Code, normal, needs work, 5 comments, 1 IRC mention
[21:03:16]    like the last 20 or so patches over the last 2 years
[21:03:24]    that's about it from me!
[21:03:46]  * rv0 has quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[21:03:54]    some of our builds in jenkins are still broken, this seems to be related to installing deb files via dpkg, which i haven't figured out yet
[21:04:26]    weird requirements like nfs-common, and the drush-make deb, etc.. and my attempt to fix it saw that restarting portmap or something failed. haven't had time to look at.
[21:06:05]     sorry if I've added to your confusion in that issue
[21:06:25]    nah it's not you. any developer would be fine with it
[21:06:43]    iam just not made of the same stuff and never have been. i should find something i'm good at and stick with it :)
[21:06:54]    don't have a coder brain
[21:07:50]     okay, well the efforts are appreciated
[21:07:54]     shall I go next?
[21:08:06]    please!
[21:08:17]     well, I've looked at a couple of issues in the queue
[21:08:52]     notably: 1185690
[21:09:10]     which is running through jenkins now
[21:09:13]     a minor fix
[21:09:34]     We'll release 1.8 next week
[21:09:38]     I think
[21:09:42]     that's it from me
[21:09:59]    nice, thanks
[21:11:07]    real shame that we lost data from the community site
[21:11:14]    niccolo wrote something interesting in response to <a href="../../../../../discuss/wheres-aegir-drupalcon-denver/index.html" title="http://community.aegirproject.org/discuss/wheres-aegir-drupalcon-denver">http://community.aegirproject.org/discuss/wheres-aegir-drupalcon-denver</a>
[21:11:36]    about how it feels like the project is sort of losing its spark, so to speak, in the wake of other beasts like pantheon
[21:11:45]    i've been wondering about that and how we can get that spark back
[21:12:02]     indeed
[21:12:13]    it's probably in the eye of the beholder, of course.. some might feel it's very new and exciting and others less so
[21:12:33]    but i don't think we ever fully recovered from the developmentseed departure
[21:12:40]     yup
[21:13:41]    I haven't got much to suggest, given I myself struggle with immense motivation issues. ho, hum
[21:13:55]     I'm now working at least a day week, at work, on Aegir
[21:14:00]    that's unreal :)
[21:14:26]    i wanted to ask how you currently do your deployments etc
[21:14:31]     so hoping to get some of the longer standing bugs sorted out
[21:15:19]     and some of the more complicated bugs that would take a few hours to set up multiple servers etc.
