<p>The Aegir team is very pleased to announce the official release of Aegir 3.0. This release ships with significant stability improvements, Drush 6 and 7 support, improved SSL, subdirectory multisite and nginx support and much, much more!</p>

<p>This release marks the deprecation of the 2.x branch. We will continue to provide security releases through the end of 2015. All Aegir users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to the 3.0 release. The upgrade has been thoroughly tested and has worked reliably for us.</p>

<p>Upgrading from Aegir 2.x moves Aegir from a Drupal 6 platform to a Drupal 7 one. The Debian package will migrate the front-end for you. While we have tested this with Aegir core, we strongly recommend disabling any contributed modules you may be running.</p>

<p>We have a very dynamic community of contrib developers, and various projects built atop Aegir. So if you were waiting for Aegir 3 to be stable, easy to install and production-ready, now is the time. The 3.x branch will be well supported as a lot of shops are running it in production already.</p>

<h2 id="Major_changes">1. Major changes</h2><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>The front-end has been ported to Drupal 7. We've also raised the minimum Drush version to 6.x, and the Debian package now installs Drush via Composer. Drush 7 is also supported.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>We've added several "Golden contrib" modules to the distribution:</span></p>

<ul>
<li><span class='diff-changed'>Hosting Remote Import</span></li><span class='diff-changed'>
</span><li><span class='diff-changed'>Hosting Site Backup Manager</span></li><span class='diff-changed'>
</span><li><span class='diff-changed'>Hosting Git</span></li><span class='diff-changed'>
</span><li><span class='diff-changed'>Hosting Tasks Extra</span></li>
</ul><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>We're planning to add additional well-supported contrib modules over the course of the Aegir 3.x lifecycle. Along similar lines, we've removed hosting_platform_pathauto, as it's built-in now.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>We've introduced initial Drupal 8 support, though this is still a work-in-progress. This mostly depends on Drupal 8 and Drush 8 stabilizing, before we'll be able to more fully manage Drupal 8 sites.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>Aegir 3 now supports SNI for SSL.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>A number of significant bug fixes and stability improvements have</span></p>

<p>to be determined.</p>

<div class="toc-back-to-top"><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></div><h2 id="Installing_and_upgrading">3. Installing and upgrading</h2>

<p>The canonical source of installation documentation is</p>

<p><a href="http://docs.aegirproject.org/en/latest/install.html" title="http://docs.aegirproject.org/en/latest/install.html">http://docs.aegirproject.org/en/latest/install.html</a></p>

<p>We're in the process of converting our docs, the old version is on  <a href="../../../../../installing/index.html" title="http://community.aegirproject.org/installing">http://community.aegirproject.org/installing</a></p>

<p>In a similar fashion, the upgrade documentation is:</p>

<pre><code>http://community.aegirproject.org/upgrading
</code></pre>

<p>Within those sections you'll find step-by-step instructions for performing both <a href="../../../../../upgrading/manual/index.html">manual</a> and <a href="../../../../../upgrading/script/index.html">automatic</a> upgrade processes.</p>

<p>Note that you should upgrade to the latest 2.x release (currently: <a href="../../../../../2/index.html">2.4</a>) before attempting the upgrade to 3.x..</p>

<p>It is still imperative that you read the <a href="../../../../../upgrading/path/index.html">upgrade path and version-specific information</a> and follow all version-specific upgrade instructions before trying to run the upgrade script or manual upgrade.</p>

<div class="toc-back-to-top"><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></div><h2 id="Need_help">4. Need help?</h2>

<p>If you struggle to install or upgrade your Aegir system, you have a number of options available to you for getting help.</p>
