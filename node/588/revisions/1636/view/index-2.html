While it's been a mostly "open secret" that most of our releases are production ready, this one has been tested through no less than 15 alpha releases, 2 beta releases and 7 release candidates, for a grand total 24 test releases before we deliver this stable version.</p>

<p>Speaking of open secrets, here's a word from our founder, <a href="https://drupal.org/node/956624">Adrian Russouw</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The 1.0 release marks the end of my association with the Aegir project, as I am officially stepping down as project leader, handing the reigns to Antoine, Miguel and the rest of the team.</p>
  
  <p>It's been public knowledge that I have not been involved with the project in the recent months as I have been in the past, owed primarily to my commitments elsewhere.</p>
  
  <p>I'm incredibly happy and proud of the progress made, even in my absence, and I see my stepping down as the completion of one of the goals I have had for this project from the outset.</p>
  
  <p>The Aegir project was built, from the ground up, to be able to function and grow even after I have moved on to new challenges, and the amazing team of maintainers we have attracted ensures its survival.</p>
  
  <p>I want to thank everybody for their support, and I wish nothing but the best for the project and it's future victories!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thank you, Adrian, for this great project you have given to the Drupal community, it means a lot to us!</p>

<p>Now onto the release. This actual release isn't much different from the previous release candidates - you can see the list of changes from the previous <a href="../../../../../1/index-13.html">RC7 release</a> at the end of those notes. However, since this is our first major release in a long time, we figured it would be important to outline how things have changed since the old days of 0.3. For those of you who weren't there, back then installing Aegir was <em>hard</em>. There was no "clone", no SSL, no multiserver. You had to migrate sites one at a time and you had to create platforms yourself (no drush make!). We were still using CVS.</p>

<p>With 1.0, we have multiserver support, Debian packages, DNS, we're using git, drush make and we have a very dynamic community of users and shops using the project. We have <a href="../../../../../roadmap/2/index.html">ambitious goals for 2.0</a> and we're eager (pun intended) to start moving again! So if you were waiting for Aegir to be <strong>stable</strong>, <strong>easy to install</strong>, <strong>production-ready</strong>, now is the time. The 1.x branch will be well supported as a lot of shops are running it in production already. What are <em>you</em> waiting for?!</p>

<h2 id="Major_changes_in_this_release">1. Major changes in this release</h2>

<p>Since our last stable release (<a href="http://groups.drupal.org/aegir/0.3">0.3</a>) in august 2009, we've done an incredible amount of work. The code size nearly doubled as the development team and user base, although we don't clearly know yet how many installs there are out there.</p>

<p>We can already say that we've been pretty successful at fulfilling our <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/25841">release goals for 0.4</a> and the <a href="../../../../../roadmap/1/index.html">1.0 roadmap</a>. Even though we're missing bits and pieces in DNS and multi-server support is not as robust as we'd like it to be, there's still space <span class='diff-changed'>for</span> improvements and bugfixes in the 1.x branch, and we'll also start on the <a href="../../../../../roadmap/2/index.html">2.0 roadmap</a> once <span class='diff-changed'>this</span> release is out the door.</p>

<div class="toc-back-to-top"><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></div><h2 id="API_changes">2. API changes</h2>

<p>The API changes since 0.3 are too numerous to list here. However, we are now committed to maintain the whole 1.x series with a stable API. There will be no change in the existing API, although we may add in some stuff if it is really necessary.</p>

<p>All future API changes between 1.x and 2.x will be clearly defined so that third party module can be supported.</p>

<div class="toc-back-to-top"><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></div><h2 id="Installing_and_upgrading">3. Installing and upgrading</h2>

<p>The canonical source of installation documentation is on the community site at:</p>

<pre><code>http://community.aegirproject.org/installing
</code></pre>

<p>In a similar fashion, the upgrade documentation is:</p>

<pre><code>http://community.aegirproject.org/upgrading
</code></pre>

<p>Within those sections you'll find step-by-step instructions for performing both <a href="../../../../../upgrading/manual/index.html">manual</a> and <a href="../../../../../upgrading/script/index.html">automatic</a> upgrade processes.</p>

<p>It is still imperative that you read the the <a href="../../../../../upgrading/path/index.html">upgrade path and version-specific information</a> and follow all version-specific upgrade instructions before trying to run the upgrade script or manual upgrade. This especially applies to users upgrading from before 0.4-alpha8, including 0.3.</p>

<p>For users coming from the 0.4 betas or recent rc releases, there are unlikely to be any version-specific manual steps required to upgrade, but you should make a habit of reading them anyway just to make sure. No-one likes a nasty surprise!</p>

<div class="toc-back-to-top"><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></div><h2 id="Need_help">4. Need help?</h2>

<p>If you struggle to install or upgrade your Aegir system, you have a number of options available to you for getting help.</p>

<p>Consult this page for more information: <a href="../../../../../help/index.html" title="http://community.aegirproject.org/help">http://community.aegirproject.org/help</a></p>

<p>Thanks to our awesome community for their help, support and encouragement as always! Enjoy the new release :)</p>

<div class="toc-back-to-top"><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></div><h2 id="Known_issues">7. Known issues</h2>

<p>Being really opened about our project, we have never hidden the fact that some things, some times, do not work in Aegir. Our issue trackers are public, and we've made it a point of honor to not only document clearly what is wrong in our releases when we find out about it, but also to reroll new releases when we fix it.</p>

<p>That being said, 1.0 suffers from a number of significant issues and design flaws. This is the list of <a href="https://drupal.org/project/issues?text=&amp;projects=provision,+hosting,+hostslave,+eldir,+Hostmaster+(Aegir)&amp;status=Open&amp;priorities=4&amp;categories=All">all issues marked "major" in the queue right now</a>. Some of those issues can be fixed within the 1.x, some can only be fixed by refactoring so they will be fixed in 2.x.</p>
