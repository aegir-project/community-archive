06:59 &lt;@anarcat&gt; SCRUM START NOW!
06:59 &lt;@anarcat&gt; welcome everyone :)
06:59 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i'll start with myself
06:59 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i am just out of a lenghty (2.5 week) vacation
06:59 &lt;@anarcat&gt; which was very good
06:59 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i have done absolutely no aegir work since decembre
07:00 &lt;@anarcat&gt; and i don't plan on doing anything until monday
07:00 &lt;@anarcat&gt; at which point we'll update our prod server to head and try to make it work
07:00 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i had big unexpected issues last time with that <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1003700" title="http://drupal.org/node/1003700">http://drupal.org/node/1003700</a>
07:00 &lt;@anarcat&gt; in general, i feel there's something very fishy with aliases, i feel this affects more than one of my server instances\
07:00 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i suspect it may be related to drush 3.3 or the drush package of
07:01 &lt;@anarcat&gt; so i'll be working on that
07:01 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i have also a huge backlog of internal aegir issues that may yield a few bugfixes
07:01 &lt;@anarcat&gt; this will be a good Q/A to maybe lead to an RC somewhere next week
07:01 &lt;@anarcat&gt; so that's it for me
07:01 &lt;@mig5&gt; nice one
07:02 &lt;@mig5&gt; i've not done much except, updated our makefiles to depend on drush 4 and new drush make
07:02 &lt;@mig5&gt; i also updated the upgrade script to remove some hardcoded crap and be more consistent with the install.sh
07:02 &lt;@anarcat&gt; coool
07:02 &lt;@mig5&gt; i *wanted* to work on DNS but sorry, I am just really struggling to do anything aegir :(
07:02 &lt;@anarcat&gt; you've actually done some real work, crazy ;)
07:02 &lt;@mig5&gt; well not really.. :s
07:03 &lt;@mig5&gt; finally, i'll just note on what i think is our most critical bug right now, and i hope to focus on this instead
07:03 &lt;@mig5&gt; <a href="http://drupal.org/node/976300" title="http://drupal.org/node/976300">http://drupal.org/node/976300</a>
07:03 &lt;@anarcat&gt; Vertice: anything to add? how is the DNS change coming up?
07:03  * anarcat takes a look
07:03 &lt;@mig5&gt; verify a remote platform/site and it deletes shit in your site's /files dir :s
07:03 &lt;@anarcat&gt; right, ok
07:03 &lt;@anarcat&gt; mig5: i think it's good to sync only some files and not the whole dir
07:03 &lt;@mig5&gt; because we do these crazy syncs of the entire codebase *after just syncing the settings.php, and then the drushrc.php, etc*
07:03 &lt;@mig5&gt; yes
07:04 &lt;@mig5&gt; anyway, can discuss that later, just wanted to mention what i think i'll focus on for the moment
07:04 &lt;@anarcat&gt; that's very good.
07:04 &lt;@mig5&gt; and that's it from me
07:04 &lt;@anarcat&gt; and it it's RC indeed
07:04 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i need Vertice to do changes to the DNS to activate ergonlogic's API site so we have api.aegirproject.org
07:04 &lt;@anarcat&gt; anyone else wants to add something?
07:04 &lt;@mig5&gt; i'd like to add to that and possibly take over the hosting of aegirproject.org at least, so we can get that updated
07:05 &lt; ergonlogic&gt; thanks anarcat
07:05 &lt;@mig5&gt; or possibly even take over the DNS for aegirproject.org itself, in the event i ever need to move the mailing list server or something
07:05 &lt; eft_&gt; mig5 : +1 to that idea
07:05 &lt;@mig5&gt; just for the sake of speed, but it's up to devseed
07:05 &lt;@anarcat&gt; yeah
07:05 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i don't mind you hosting that, koumbit can also host DNS and the site
07:05 &lt;@mig5&gt; yeah either way :)
07:05 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i offered this to Vertice, i expect us to have DNS soon
07:05 &lt;@mig5&gt; cool
07:05 &lt;@anarcat&gt; (us = koumbit)
07:05 &lt;@mig5&gt; yep
07:06 &lt;@anarcat&gt; but for the site, yeah, it would be important to at least have a backup ...
07:06 &lt;@mig5&gt; darthsteven: feel free to chime in - you've been doing great work with contrib aegir stuff
07:06 &lt; darthsteven&gt; ah okay
07:06 &lt; eft_&gt; either way, it would be nice to increase the cookie timeout on community.aegir.org
07:06 &lt;@anarcat&gt; yeah, if anyone else wants to jump in, feel free to talk :)
07:06 &lt; darthsteven&gt; So I've been thinking mostly
07:06 &lt;@anarcat&gt; if you're doing dev on aegir, now's the time to talk (after darthsteven :)
07:06 &lt; darthsteven&gt; Mainly about provision contexts
07:07 &lt; darthsteven&gt; and provision-save and services and how all the pieces fit together
07:07 &lt; darthsteven&gt; I have an outline for a handbook page(s) that should document most of what's going on
07:08 &lt;@mig5&gt; oh that'd be nice. since you have chosen the bit that no-one understands how it really is meant to work :)
07:08 &lt; darthsteven&gt; Nothing new in contrib land from me this week
07:08 &lt;@anarcat&gt; cool
07:08 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i think Vertice did some work in that direction in the handbook already
07:08 &lt;@anarcat&gt; ok
07:08 &lt;@anarcat&gt; anyone else?
07:08 &lt; darthsteven&gt; mig5: yeah, it is complex...
07:08 &lt; darthsteven&gt; that's it from me
07:08 &lt;@mig5&gt; yes darthsteven <a href="../41/index.html" title="http://community.aegirproject.org/node/41">http://community.aegirproject.org/node/41</a> have a read of that if you've not already
07:09 &lt;@anarcat&gt; cool
07:09 &lt;@anarcat&gt; ok last call, anyone else?
07:09 &lt;@anarcat&gt; anybody have time to log this into the community site?
07:09 &lt;@mig5&gt; sure
07:09 &lt;@mig5&gt; thanks all! goodscrum
07:10 &lt;@anarcat&gt; thanks!
07:10 &lt;@anarcat&gt; happy new year everybody, and thanks for attending!
07:10 &lt;@anarcat&gt; SCRUM END!
