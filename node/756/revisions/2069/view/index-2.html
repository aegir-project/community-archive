<p>The Aegir team is happy to release the third stable release in the 1.x branch. We have found only one critical bug (in Nginx support) but have fixed so many little bugs that we figured it was about time to make a new release.</p>

<p>The major changes from 1.1 are that we now support the wget cron method for D7, and have fixed a lot of issues in the Nginx support. In addition, there is now the ability to "purge" platforms that Aegir might not otherwise recognize as eligible for deletion, and have robots.txt on a per-site basis. Finally, the "wget" support for cron.php has been rewritten with drupal_http_request(), so it's much faster and will detect errors properly - no more discrepancies between Aegir's idea of when cron was ran and the site's.</p>

<p>We've put in place a continuous integration server (Jenkins), which has allowed us to start automated testing of the Debian packages. This helps to ensure that automated installation of the software is stable. People wishing to test the latest development version of the 1.x tree can now install packages from the "unstable" repository; more information can be found here: <a href="../../../../../debian/index.html#Package_versionning" title="http://community.aegirproject.org/debian#Package_versionning">http://community.aegirproject.org/debian#Package_versionning</a></p>

<p>While not specific to this release, we have made extensive improvements to the documentation that can be found at <a href="../../../../../handbook/index.html" title="http://community.aegirproject.org/handbook">http://community.aegirproject.org/handbook</a>, as well as API documentation on <a href="http://api.aegirproject.org/" title="http://api.aegirproject.org">http://api.aegirproject.org</a></p>

<p>Also, we've begun to accept donations in order to cover various project costs. As an open source project, we need the support of the community to ensure ongoing development and support. Koumbit is pleased to provide administrative support for this, and you can find the donation page on their site: <a href="http://membres.koumbit.org/en/civicrm/contribute/transact?reset=1&amp;id=5" title="http://membres.koumbit.org/en/civicrm/contribute/transact?reset=1&amp;id=5">http://membres.koumbit.org/en/civicrm/contribute/transact?reset=1&amp;id=5</a>, which is also linked to directly from the front page of the community site.</p>

<p>See <a href="../../../../../1/index-10.html">the detailed release notes</a> for install instructions and a detailed list of bugfixes.</p>    </div>
