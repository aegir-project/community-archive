</span><div class="toc-back-to-top"><span class='diff-deleted'></span><a href="#toc"><span class='diff-deleted'>Back</span><span class='diff-deleted'> </span><span class='diff-deleted'>to</span><span class='diff-deleted'> </span><span class='diff-deleted'>top</span></a><span class='diff-deleted'></span></div><span class='diff-deleted'></span><h1 id="Branch_naming_conventions"><span class='diff-deleted'>2.</span> Branch naming conventions</h1>

<p>All branches are either development branches, stable branches or feature branches. Development and stable branches have the same naming convention:  <code>6.x-1.x</code> or <code>7.x-2.x</code>. The only different between the two is that a stable branch is the branch where stable releases are published from.</p>

<p><em>Note</em>: since the <a href="../../../../385/index.html">great git.drupal.org migration</a>, we are back on Drupal.org and have been forced to change some of our naming convention, especially to include the core release number in the tag (so <code>6.x-1.x</code>), which is a source of confusion for our <code>provision</code> module which supports any Drupal core version.  See <a href="http://drupal.org/node/322626#comment-4116688">this issue on drupal.org</a> for followup.</p>

<div class="toc-back-to-top"><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></div><h2 id="Main_development_branch"><span class='diff-changed'>1.1.</span> Main development branch</h2>

<p>The main development branch is created after a fully stable release is published. For example, the <code>7.x-2.x</code> branch will be created once the 1.0 release is published. It will be a development branch until it is considered feature-complete and goes through the alpha/beta/rc release cycle, at which point it will be declared a stable branch and a new development branch will be created (probably <code>8.x-3.x</code> at that point).</p>

<p>Note that we have <a href="../../../../524/index.html">dropped the master branch</a> as it is not well supported on Drupal.org for releases.</p>

<div class="toc-back-to-top"><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></div><h2 id="Stable_release_branches"><span class='diff-changed'>1.2.</span> Stable release branches</h2>

<p>Stable releases are performed from stable release branches. A branch is declared stable only after it went through the complete alpha/beta/rc release cycle, as detailed above..</p>

<p>Once the branch is declared stable, new releases are quickly done as "hotfixes", without intervening alpha/beta/rc releases. So for example, <code>6.x-1.0</code> will come after <code>6.x-1.0-alpha1</code>, <code>6.x-1.0-beta1</code>, <code>6.x-1.0-rc1</code> <em>at least</em>, and then be followed directly by <code>6.x-1.1</code>.</p>

<p>Releases on the same stable branch are API-compatible with each other (so <code>1.1</code> is compatible with <code>1.0</code>). The upgrade path is supported between major stable releases (so you can upgrade from <code>1.0</code> to <code>1.1</code> or <code>2.0</code>).</p>

<p><strong>Special case</strong>: during the 0.x release cycle, releases were not API-compatible with each other, ie. 0.4 was <em>not</em> compatible with 0.3, and you could barely upgrade from 0.3 to 0.4.</p>

<p>Only one stable branch is maintained at a time.</p>

<div class="toc-back-to-top"><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></div><h2 id="Feature_branches"><span class='diff-changed'>1.3.</span> Feature branches</h2>

<p>More complex development goes into development or "feature" branches, to avoid making <code>master</code> too unstable. Feature branches must be prefixed with "dev-" and use the issue number (if available or relevant) and a short name. So for example, there could be work on a <code>dev-12345-mybug</code> branch or <code>dev-dns</code> branch for a larger feature (DNS, in that case) which doesn't fit in a single issue.</p>

<p>Feature branches should be based of a known stable baseline as much as possible. For example, you should branch off the last alpha release if you want to make merging with other dev branches and master easier. See <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/story/10/11/30/1649231/Linus-On-Branching-Practices">this article</a> for a thorough discussion on this practice</p>

<div class="toc-back-to-top"><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></div><h1 id="Tag_naming_convention"><span class='diff-changed'>2.</span> Tag naming convention</h1>

<p>Every release is tagged with a <code>6.x-x.y</code> tag (e.g. <code>6.x-0.4</code>, <code>6.x-0.4-alpha15</code> or <code>6.x-1.0</code>). Those tags are usually laid on the stable branches, except for alpha/beta/rc releases which are laid on the development branch.</p>

<div class="toc-back-to-top"><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></div><h1 id="CVS_and_git_history"><span class='diff-changed'>3.</span> CVS and git history</h1>

<p>The CVS tags and branches are still accessible in git and will be kept there for posterity. They respect the traditional Drupal.org naming convention.</p>

<p>They have also been converted to the new git.drupal.org conventions during the <a href="../../../../385/index.html">great git.drupal.org migration</a>.</p>

<p>Since that migration (february 2011), history has been rewritten to clean up the authors in the history.</p><div class="toc-back-to-top"><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></div><script type="text/javascript">toc_scroll_back_to_top = 1;</script></div>    </div>
