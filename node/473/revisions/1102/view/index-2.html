<p><span class='diff-changed'>Yes, you read</span> that <span class='diff-changed'>right: 1.0! We've</span> decided to rename the 0.4 branch to 1.0.</p>

<p>This is the second <span class='diff-changed'>Release Candidate</span> from which we will test fixes to critical bugs from rc1, as well as fix any additional critical bugs found since, until we have no criticals and will then roll out the official 1.0.</p>

<h2>Key changes in 1.0-rc2</h2>

<p>There are a lot of bug fixes and features added into this release.</p>

<p>INSTALL.txt and UPGRADE.txt, along with the various architecture hints, and other developer docs, have been moved to the community site under:</p>

<pre><code>http://community.aegirproject.org/administrator-manual
</code></pre>

<p>The Aegir git repositories have moved back to <span class='diff-changed'>drupal.org, we're back in the family!</span></p>

<p><span class='diff-changed'>We have fixed some key issues that were discovered during testing, including sites that were not put offline during migrations and data loss issues in multiserver migration. We have also worked on the upgrade path for legacy (pre alpha9) installs, which should be able to upgrade to this release directly.</span></p>

<p><span class='diff-added'>Also, we've moved to Drush Make 2.1, and (maybe) Drush 4.3!</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><h2><span class='diff-added'>Known Issues</span></h2><span class='diff-added'>

</span><ul><span class='diff-added'>
</span><li>DNS has no access control - anybody can create any zone <span class='diff-changed'>(#922252)</span></li><span class='diff-changed'>
</span><li><span class='diff-changed'>The</span> site form suffers from some performance issues when you have a lot of platforms <span class='diff-changed'>(#955854)</span></li><span class='diff-changed'>
</span><li><span class='diff-changed'>Cluster</span> servers are probably broken right now <span class='diff-changed'>(#1016890)

<p>For users of 0.4-rc1 and earlier, we offer an upgrade.sh script in Provision, which tries to automate many of the steps outlined at:</p>

<pre><code>http://community.aegirproject.org/upgrading
</code></pre>

<p>It is still imperative that you read the the Upgrade Guide (<a href="../../../../../upgrading/index.html" title="http://community.aegirproject.org/upgrading">http://community.aegirproject.org/upgrading</a>) and follow all version-specific upgrade instructions located at the end of the document before trying to run the upgrade script. This especially applies to users upgrading from before 0.4-alpha8, including 0.3.</p>

<p>For users coming from 0.4-beta1, beta2 or rc1, there are unlikely to be any version-specific manual steps required to upgrade to 1.0-rc2, but you should make a habit of reading them anyway just to make sure. No-one likes a nasty surprise!</p>

<p>The upgrade.sh script attempts to backup the existing backend components, download new versions, and then run the hostmaster-migrate command. It assumes you are upgrading from the previous release (hostmaster-0.4-rc1). If you are not, you may have to edit the script to change the OLD_DRUPAL_DIR variable.</p>

</span><h2>No Drush 4?</h2>

<p>Some people might be wondering why we haven't changed the install.sh or upgrade.sh scripts to fetch the latest Drush 4.2 release.</p><span class='diff-deleted'>

</span><p><span class='diff-deleted'>Drush</span></p>

<p>Drush 4.2 has a bug which breaks rsync and possibly other stuff when using multiserver.</p>

<p>It's been fixed in Drush, but we are awaiting a 4.3 release before we roll with it. If you see 4.3 come out, you can probably upgrade your Drush if you wish (we tested this morning and are in fact compatible with Drush HEAD at time of writing).</p>

<p>See this ticket for more: <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1041386" title="http://drupal.org/node/1041386">http://drupal.org/node/1041386</a></p>

<p>We are working with the Drush developers to attempt to 'sync' our releases in future, but we wanted to roll out rc2 to all you good folk sooner rather than later this time :)</p>

<h2>Need help?</h2>

<p>If you struggle to install or upgrade your Aegir system, you have a number of options available to you for getting help.</p>
