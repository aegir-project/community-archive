[06:59:17]     Every Monday at 20h00 UTC: 12h00 San Francisco, USA (PDT), 15h00 Montreal, Canada (EDT), 20h00 London, UK (GMT), 07h00 (Tuesday) Melbourne, Australia (EST)
[07:00:10]      hi all
[07:00:46]     hi all!
[07:00:54]     hi
[07:00:54]     what's up
[07:01:22]     so i can start i guess
[07:01:30]     i have worked a bit more on aegir in the last week
[07:01:40]     i have merged the pack branch into 1.x and 2.x
[07:01:47]     assuming that it was okay to ship 1.7 with it
[07:01:59]     i am working on the import documentation today
[07:02:11]     what else
[07:02:19]     oh, i want to merge the debian branch into 1.x and 2.x
[07:02:23]     so that we can start building 2.x packages
[07:02:38]     we need to figure out <em>where</em> they would be uploaded, because that would override the 1.x packages
[07:02:46]     but maybe we can just make another reprepro archive or something
[07:03:06]     what else what else
[07:03:22]     oh
[07:03:31]     i would really like to see us switch to vagrant for jenkins
[07:03:35]     but i have no time to take care of it
[07:03:45]     i am tired of false positives and i'd like to be able to test aegir with vagrant
[07:03:58]     vagrant should hit debian testing this week, so i'll install it at hme and may start playing with it
[07:04:09]     other than that, don't count on me for vagrant stuff too much :)
[07:04:12]     alright, that's it for me
[07:04:36]      k, thanks anarcat
[07:04:43]      I'll go next
[07:04:54]     <a href="../../../../../content/content/administrator/post-ins/index.html" title="http://community.aegirproject.org/content/content/administrator/post-ins">http://community.aegirproject.org/content/content/administrator/post-ins</a>...
[07:04:58]     go!
[07:05:10]      I've updated aegir-up to run on the latest vagrant (0.9.8)
[07:05:28]      and I've been using it to improve the puppet-aegir module
[07:06:00]      so, I have plenty of experience with aegir running on vagrant, but none w/ Jenkins
[07:06:40]      I've been poking around a bit
[07:07:17]     cool beans
[07:07:24]      but I'd prefer to help someone with more jenkins experience, rather than try to do it myself
[07:07:50]      anyway, we can now specify all the hostmaster variables in the puppet module
[07:08:00]      and I'm currently working on supporting manual installs
[07:08:18]      and I'm stuck at 'hostmaster-install' but I think I see a light at the end of the tunnel
[07:08:29]      that's pretty much it for me
[07:09:11]     me next
[07:09:19]     I've had some time to fix some bugs!
[07:09:21]     yey!
[07:09:37]     yay!
[07:09:41]     so 1.7 will have many fewer notices in the logs
[07:09:57]     and the site form now works in Internet Explorer
[07:09:58]     :)
[07:10:01]     wow
[07:10:04]      nice
[07:10:04]     incredible
[07:10:07]     IE6? :P
[07:10:12]     fixing some more simple bugs tonight
[07:10:17]     hah!
[07:10:19]     not likely
[07:10:21]     sorry for the swearing ;)
[07:10:29]     should we look at releasing 1.7 soon?
[07:10:30]     that's it from me
[07:11:17]     it seems that omega8cc has a few patches sitting in the queue, i think mig5 looked at a few of those, but we should probably factor them in
[07:11:37]     also, it seems to me that we should punish omega8cc with commit access, for too long they have been submitting good patches for nginx ;)
[07:11:37]      if we do a 1.7 soon, I'd suggest we stick with Drupal 6.23, as 6.24 seems to have a couple bugs
[07:11:46]     crap
[07:12:11]    heh, I'm still in the 'port hundreds of Nginx config changes from BOA fork to Aegir 1.x and 2.x' phase.
[07:12:14]    I didn't realize how far it got, but we will get it back in sync with our dear upstream again :)
[07:12:26]     i am happy to hear that! :)
[07:12:30]    We are almost there, anyway.
[07:12:42]     i am especially curious to see that "no create content stupid submenu" patch :)
[07:12:48]    6.24 is fine with two patches
[07:12:52]     that would be a great improvement
[07:13:03]    yeah
[07:13:05]     we could ship with patches to the makefile...
[07:13:45]     alright, anyone else?
[07:13:50]      If we're going forward with a 1.7, I'll post an issue to track it
[07:14:16]      omega8cc: if you could comment there with the patches, that would be great
[07:14:30]     ergonlogic: let's
[07:14:37]      I'm on it
[07:15:06]     alright, anyone else has something to add to our scrum?
[07:15:16]     otherwise i think we're done, thanks everyone for your attention
[07:15:57]    ergonlogic: basically: <a href="https://github.com/omega8cc/pressflow6/commit/97b8df2795e9565ffff5dcaa00" title="https://github.com/omega8cc/pressflow6/commit/97b8df2795e9565ffff5dcaa00">https://github.com/omega8cc/pressflow6/commit/97b8df2795e9565ffff5dcaa00</a>... and <a href="https://github.com/omega8cc/pressflow6/commit/4b05a210c4234714104149c3ef" title="https://github.com/omega8cc/pressflow6/commit/4b05a210c4234714104149c3ef">https://github.com/omega8cc/pressflow6/commit/4b05a210c4234714104149c3ef</a>...
[07:16:40]    there are two major issues only, both listed at <a href="http://drupal.org/drupal-7.12" title="http://drupal.org/drupal-7.12">http://drupal.org/drupal-7.12</a>
[07:16:41]     omega8cc: are those patches upstream?
