<p>Aegir is also made up of several separate components designed to work together.</p>

<h1>Repositories locations</h1>

<p>Once upon a time, these components were stored on drupal.org and managed using Drupal's CVS system. Remnants of those projects are still located on drupal.org and for historical purposes, we maintain the Issue queues in their original locations there.</p>

<p>The git repositories are stored on <a href="http://koumbit.org/">Koumbit's</a> servers.</p>

<p>There is a web interface for your perusal at <a href="http://git.aegirproject.org/" title="http://git.aegirproject.org">http://git.aegirproject.org</a></p>

<p>There are the URLs you can use to pull the repositories:</p>

<ul>
<li>Provision - <code>git clone git://git.aegirproject.org/provision</code></li>
<li><p>Hostmaster - <code>git clone git://git.aegirproject.org/hostmaster</code></p></li>
<li><p>Drush is also available through an unofficial repo: <code>git clone git://git.koumbit.net/drupal/modules/drush</code>. This repository is synced with CVS every thirty minutes.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Developers with push access to the repositories should pull via SSH.</p>

<h1>Branch naming convention</h1>

<ul>
<li><code>master</code> is always the main development branch. Think of it as CVS <code>HEAD</code>. When you commit there, you make everyone suffer, so unless you are confident your change needs to be in the mainline, you are likely to want to use feature branches (below).</li>
<li><code>aegir-0.x</code> are stable branch releases, where <code>aegir</code> is the subproject name (e.g. <code>provision-0.4-alpha3</code>, <code>hostmaster-0.4</code>). We don't have that in CVS: they allow us to roll point releases on our production releases. This branch will have tags like <code>aegir-0.x.1, aegir-0.x.2, aegir-0.x.y</code>. Once we hit 1.0, it's exactly the same thing without the 0.: branch is <code>aegir-1</code> and tags are <code>aegir-1.x</code>. Commits to those branches should be first tested on the master branch (if possible) and then carefully tested there through alpha/beta/rc stages before a new tag is laid.</li>
<li>development or "feature" branches must be prefixed with "dev-" and use the issue number (if available or relevant) and a short name. So for example, there could be work on a <code>dev-12345-mybug</code> branch or <code>dev-dns</code> branch for a larger feature (DNS, in that case) which doesn't fit in a single issue.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important that this naming convention be followed, particularly for release tags, as the tags are used to generate the tarballs published on <a href="http://files.aegirproject.org/" title="http://files.aegirproject.org/">http://files.aegirproject.org/</a>. (See <a href="http://git.koumbit.net/?p=tools/git-hooks/.git;a=blob;f=archive-tag">this script</a> for details on how this works.) So if a tag named <code>provision-0.4</code> is pushed, the <code>provision-0.4.tgz</code> file will be generated.</p>

<p>Deprecated and/or merged branches will be moved to an eventual "attic", a clone of the main repository that will keep all dead branches. We will cleanup every major release.</p>

<p>The CVS tags and branches are still accessible in git and will be kept there for posterity. They respect the traditional Drupal.org naming convention.</p><span class='diff-deleted'>
