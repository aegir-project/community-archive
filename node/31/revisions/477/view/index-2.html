</span><p>Once upon a time, these components were stored on drupal.org and managed using Drupal's CVS system. Remnants of those projects are still located on drupal.org and for historical purposes, we maintain the Issue queues in their original locations there.</p>

<p>The git repositories are stored on <a href="http://koumbit.org/">Koumbit's</a> servers.</p>

<p>There is a web interface for your perusal at <a href="http://git.aegirproject.org/" title="http://git.aegirproject.org">http://git.aegirproject.org</a></p>

<p>There are the URLs you can use to pull the repositories:</p>

<ul>
<li>Provision - <code>git clone git://git.aegirproject.org/provision</code></li>
<li><p>Hostmaster - <code>git clone git://git.aegirproject.org/hostmaster</code></p></li>
<li><p>Drush is also available through an unofficial repo: <code>git clone git://git.koumbit.net/drupal/modules/drush</code>. This repository is synced with CVS every thirty minutes.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Developers with push access to the repositories should pull via SSH.</p><span class='diff-deleted'>
