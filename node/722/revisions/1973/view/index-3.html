<h2 id="Installing_and_upgrading">1. Installing and upgrading</h2>

<p>The canonical source of installation documentation is on the community site at:</p>

<pre><code>http://community.aegirproject.org/installing
</code></pre>

<p>In a similar fashion, the upgrade documentation is:</p>

<pre><code>http://community.aegirproject.org/upgrading

<p>Within those sections you'll find step-by-step instructions for performing both <a href="../../../../../upgrading/manual/index.html">manual</a> and <a href="../../../../../upgrading/script/index.html">automatic</a> upgrade processes.</p>

<p>It is still imperative that you read the the <a href="../../../../../upgrading/path/index.html">upgrade path and version-specific information</a> and follow all version-specific upgrade instructions before trying to run the upgrade script or manual upgrade. This especially applies to users upgrading from before 0.4-alpha8, including 0.3.</p>

<p>For users coming from the 0.4 betas or recent rc releases, there are unlikely to be any version-specific manual steps required to upgrade, but you should make a habit of reading them anyway just to make sure. No-one likes a nasty surprise!</p>

<ul>
<li>Problems remain with the upgrade path. A hotfix is available in <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1121406">#1121406</a> and the tags have been rerolled so that new upgrades do not suffer from this problem</li>
<li>The makefiles released with rc4, rc5 and rc6 were broken, you need to apply <a href="http://drupalcode.org/project/provision.git/patch/64d5fb0af66d50fcecdf0c245cddc5ae85d29acc">this patch to the aegir.make</a> file in the provision module, see the <a href="http://drupal.org/patch/apply">Applying patches article on drupal.org</a> to apply patches. The patch needs to be applied after <a href="../../../../../installing/manual/index.html#Install_provision">step 5.2 in the manual install process</a>. The Debian packages have been fixed in <code>1.0~rc6-2</code>. See bug <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1122942">#1122942</a> for followup.</li>
<li>Ubuntu users are having problems installing the <a href="../../../../548/index.html">Debian packages</a> - we need to have a proper backtrace to debug this issue</li>
</ul>

<p>The Debian package are still in testing mode and feedback there is appreciated.</p>

<p>We have now specific <a href="../../../../../maintainers/index.html">maintainers</a> for specific project areas.</p>

<p>A documentation spree has been started by the newly documentation team and merged in this release, so the <a href="http://api.aegirproject.org/">API documentation</a> should be more complete. In particular, we have deprecated hosting_queues_get_arguments() and hook_provision_args() that weren't used anywhere.</p>

      <p>The Aegir team is very pleased to announce the <em>fifth</em> release candidate of Aegir 1.0!</p>

<p>This is a hotfix release to fix a major issue in the upgrade path. All users are strongly encouraged to skip the rc4 release and upgrade here instead.</p>

<h2>Changes in 1.0-rc5</h2>

<ul>
<li>fix the upgrade path (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/1118558">#1118558</a>)</li>
<li>fix upgrade.sh to have the right older version all the time and automatically detect drush (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/1117776">#1117776</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Known issues</h2>

<ul>
<li>Drupal 7 support is broken (hotfix available in <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1119850">#1119850</a>)</li>
<li>upgrade.sh is broken again, use <a href="http://drupalcode.org/project/provision.git/blob_plain/84e633b505df86b68823ad12458bfd837999751f:/upgrade.sh.txt">this version</a> instead until rc6 comes out</li>

</ul></div><p>The Aegir team is very pleased to announce the fourth release candidate of Aegir 1.0!</p>

<p>We have again found critical issues in rc3, detailed below, and a few key features that we wanted to slip into 1.0 that were just low-hanging fruits that deserved to be released. We hope this release candidate will be all shiny and without any critical issues so we can release it as 1.0.</p>

<p><em>Update</em>: because of a last minute API change, the upgrade path is broken and it is not recommended to upgrade to this release. A new release has been published, so use <a href="../../../../../1/index-15.html">1.0-rc5</a> instead. See <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1118558">#1118558</a> for more information.</p>

<h2>Key changes in 1.0-rc4</h2>

<ul>
<li>There is now a <code>~/clients</code> directory in which symlink are automatically created to allow easy access to all your client sites (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/1115960">#1115960</a>)</li>
<li>A variable is now set in <code>settings.php</code> (<code>aegir_api</code>) to allow contrib modules to inspect what Aegir version they are dealing with, if any. The setting is removed on export, that is, if dbcloaking is off (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/1027358">#1027358</a>)</li>
<li>We fixed a big regression where the mass migrate form stopped working in rc3 (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/1111532">#1111532</a>)</li>
<li>The <code>private</code> directory of Drupal 7 is now properly protected (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/1108810">#1108810</a>)</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../../../installing/debian/index.html">Debian package</a> has been tested over and over again and is now the prefered install method for people on Debian</li>
<li>Consequently, <code>install.sh</code> has been removed and the <a href="../../../../../installing/manual/index.html">manual install instructions</a> have been revamped to be clearer, see <a href="../../../../542/index.html">this post</a> for more information about the reasoning behind that change</li>
</ul>

<h2>Known issues</h2>

<ul>
<li>DNS has no access control - anybody can create any zone (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/922252">#922252</a>)</li>
<li>The site form suffers from some performance issues when you have a lot of platforms (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/955854">#955854</a>)</li>
<li>Cluster servers are probably broken right now (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/1016890">#1016890</a>)</li>
<li>Aliases are not persisted across Migrate, (Rename), Clone (provision-deploy) (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/1004526">#1004526</a>)</li>
<li>Upgrade path is broken (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/1118558">#1118558</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installing and upgrading</h2>

<p>The canonical source of installation documentation has moved from the usual INSTALL.txt to the community site at:</p>

<pre><code>http://community.aegirproject.org/installing
</code></pre>

<p>In a similar fashion, the upgrade documentation has now been moved to the community site at</p>

<pre><code>http://community.aegirproject.org/upgrading
</code></pre>

<p>Within those sections you'll find step-by-step instructions for performing both manual and automatic upgrade processes. You can download the upgrade.sh.txt script from <a href="../../../../431/index.html" title="http://community.aegirproject.org/node/431">http://community.aegirproject.org/node/431</a>.</p>

<p>It is still imperative that you read the the Upgrade Guide (<a href="../../../../../upgrading/index.html" title="http://community.aegirproject.org/upgrading">http://community.aegirproject.org/upgrading</a>) and follow all version-specific upgrade instructions located at the end of the document before trying to run the upgrade script. This especially applies to users upgrading from before 0.4-alpha8, including 0.3.</p>

<p>For users coming from the 0.4 betas or rc1/2, there are unlikely to be any version-specific manual steps required to upgrade to 1.0-rc4, but you should make a habit of reading them anyway just to make sure. No-one likes a nasty surprise!</p>

<p>The upgrade.sh script attempts to backup the existing backend components, download new versions, and then run the hostmaster-migrate command. It assumes you are upgrading from the previous release (hostmaster-6.x-1.0-rc3). If you are not, you may have to edit the script to change the OLD_DRUPAL_DIR variable.</p>

<p>The Aegir team is very pleased to announce the third release candidate of Aegir 1.0!</p>

<p>This is the third Release Candidate from which we will test fixes to critical bugs from rc2, as well as fix any additional critical bugs found since, until we have no criticals and will then roll out the official 1.0.</p>

<p>This release also includes a fix for a security vulnerability (see below). We recommend you upgrade your Aegir instance to apply this fix.</p>

<h2>Key changes in 1.0-rc3</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>A security vulnerability was fixed that prevents arbitrary configuration from being injected into Apache vhosts by way of the Site Aliases form. See <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1098304">#1098304</a></p></li>
<li><p>The 'Client' feature / node type has been significantly refactored and simplified, with the ultimate aim of hooking it into other CRM/databases (e.g. for LDAP support), and better Aegir-managed site/user security. This involved an exception to our current 'API freeze' for the sake of getting this important refactoring in. See <a href="../../../../521/index.html">this summary of the changes</a> this imposes</p></li>
<li><p>We've upgraded to use Drush 4.4 and Drush Make 2.2 on fresh installs and upgrades. These have been tested and should work without any problems.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Known Issues</h2>

<ul>
<li>DNS has no access control - anybody can create any zone (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/922252">#922252</a>)</li>
<li>The site form suffers from some performance issues when you have a lot of platforms (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/955854">#955854</a>)</li>
<li>Cluster servers are probably broken right now (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/1016890">#1016890</a>)</li>
<li>Aliases are not persisted across Migrate, (Rename), Clone (provision-deploy) (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/1004526">#1004526</a>)</li>
<li>The provision.info version tag wasn't updated properly and still reads 1.0-rc2</li>

</ul>

<h2>Installing and upgrading</h2>

<p>The canonical source of installation documentation has moved from the usual INSTALL.txt to the community site at:</p>

<pre><code>http://community.aegirproject.org/installing
</code></pre>

<p>In a similar fashion, the upgrade documentation has now been moved to the community site at</p>

<pre><code>http://community.aegirproject.org/upgrading
</code></pre>

<p>Within those sections you'll find step-by-step instructions for performing both manual and automatic upgrade processes. You can download the upgrade.sh.txt script from <a href="../../../../431/index.html" title="http://community.aegirproject.org/node/431">http://community.aegirproject.org/node/431</a>.</p>

<p>It is still imperative that you read the the Upgrade Guide (<a href="../../../../../upgrading/index.html" title="http://community.aegirproject.org/upgrading">http://community.aegirproject.org/upgrading</a>) and follow all version-specific upgrade instructions located at the end of the document before trying to run the upgrade script. This especially applies to users upgrading from before 0.4-alpha8, including 0.3.</p>

<p>For users coming from the 0.4 betas or rc1/2, there are unlikely to be any version-specific manual steps required to upgrade to 1.0-rc3, but you should make a habit of reading them anyway just to make sure. No-one likes a nasty surprise!</p>

<p>The upgrade.sh script attempts to backup the existing backend components, download new versions, and then run the hostmaster-migrate command. It assumes you are upgrading from the previous release (hostmaster-6.x-1.0-rc2). If you are not, you may have to edit the script to change the OLD_DRUPAL_DIR variable.</p>

      <p>The Aegir team is very pleased to announce the second release candidate of Aegir 1.0!</p>

<p>Yes, you read that right: 1.0! We've decided to rename the 0.4 branch to 1.0.</p>

<p>This is the second Release Candidate from which we will test fixes to critical bugs from rc1, as well as fix any additional critical bugs found since, until we have no criticals and will then roll out the official 1.0.</p>

<h2>Key changes in 1.0-rc2</h2>

<p>There are a lot of bug fixes and features added into this release.</p>

<p>INSTALL.txt and UPGRADE.txt, along with the various architecture hints, and other developer docs, have been moved to the community site under:</p>

<pre><code>http://community.aegirproject.org/administrator-manual
</code></pre>

<p>The Aegir git repositories have moved back to drupal.org, we're back in the family!</p>

<p>We have fixed some key issues that were discovered during testing, including sites that were not put offline during migrations and data loss issues in multiserver migration. We have also worked on the upgrade path for legacy (pre alpha9) installs, which should be able to upgrade to this release directly.</p>

<p>Finally, we fixed a CSRF attack on the task form that allowed an attacker to force a user to run tasks on existing sites and platforms. This is non-critical as only tasks with no confirmation dialog (ie. safe tasks) could be triggered.</p>

<p>Also, we've moved to Drush Make 2.1!</p>

<h2>Known Issues</h2>

<li>DNS has no access control - anybody can create any zone (#922252)</li>

<h2>No Drush 4?</h2>

<p>Some people might be wondering why we haven't changed the install.sh or upgrade.sh scripts to fetch the latest Drush 4.2 release.</p>

<p>Drush 4.2 has a bug which breaks rsync and possibly other stuff when using multiserver.</p>

<p>It's been fixed in Drush, but we are awaiting a 4.3 release before we roll with it. If you see 4.3 come out, you can probably upgrade your Drush if you wish (we tested this morning and are in fact compatible with Drush HEAD at time of writing).</p>

<p>See this ticket for more: <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1041386" title="http://drupal.org/node/1041386">http://drupal.org/node/1041386</a></p>

<p>We are working with the Drush developers to attempt to 'sync' our releases in future, but we wanted to roll out rc2 to all you good folk sooner rather than later this time :)</p>

      <p>The Aegir team is very pleased to announce the first release candidate of Aegir 0.4!</p>

<p>This is the first rc from which we will go into crazy bugfixing mode until we have no criticals and will then roll out the official 0.4.</p>

<h2>Key changes in 0.4-rc1</h2>

<p>There are a lot of bug fixes and features added into this release.</p>

<p>Significantly, a major data-loss bug was fixed in Multiserver environments, that was causing a remote site's 'files' directory contents to be deleted if those files didn't already exist on the 'master' copy of the site on the hostmaster system.</p>

<p>Also, we stopped hardcoding "$conf['cache'] = 1" in sites' settings.php, returning control over the caching function back to the user by way of:</p>

<ul>
<li>inserting the preferred setting into a file called 'local.settings.php' alongside the settings.php so it won't be clobbered by the template, or</li>
<li>same as above but in /var/aegir/config/includes/global.inc to set it globally for all sites, or</li>
<li>setting it in /admin/settings/performance on your site, and having that setting stick instead of being reset by the hardcode.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Known Issues</h2>

<ul>
<li>DNS has no access control - anybody can create any zone (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/922252">#922252</a>)</li>
<li>The site form suffers from some performance issues when you have a lot of platforms (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/955854">#955854</a>)</li>
<li>Cluster servers are probably broken right now (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/1016890">#1016890</a>)</li>
<li>Aliases are not persisted across Migrate, (Rename), Clone (provision-deploy) (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/1004526">#1004526</a>)</li>

<h2>Installing and upgrading</h2>

<p>The canonical source of installation documentation is as usual the excellent <a href="http://git.aegirproject.org/?p=provision.git;a=blob_plain;f=docs/INSTALL.txt;hb=provision-0.4-rc1">INSTALL.txt</a>. The hostmaster and provision tarballs have the following checksums:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>provision-0.4-rc1.tgz: 6f4da4ba7dcfaa1bcc3c44f96beb3eda</code></li>
<li><code>hostmaster-0.4-rc1.tgz: b2a42b151b817c1ea6cdf15462aa2e15</code></li>
</ul>

<p>For users who have Rackspace Cloud accounts and want to install Aegir in the cloud, you are welcome to try mig5's <a href="http://github.com/mig5/frigg">Frigg script</a>, which automatically creates a new virtual server and installs Aegir, with one command!</p>

<p>For users of 0.4-beta2 and earlier, we offer an <a href="http://git.aegirproject.org/?p=provision.git;a=blob_plain;f=upgrade.sh.txt;hb=provision-0.4-rc1">upgrade.sh script</a> in Provision, which tries to automate much of the steps outlined in the <a href="http://git.aegirproject.org/?p=provision.git;a=blob_plain;f=docs/UPGRADE.txt;hb=provision-0.4-rc1">UPGRADE.txt</a>.</p>

<p>It is still imperative that you read the UPGRADE.txt and follow all version-specific upgrade instructions located at the end of the document before trying to run the upgrade script. This especially applies to users upgrading from before 0.4-alpha8, including 0.3.</p>

<p>For users coming from 0.4-beta1 or beta2, there are unlikely to be any version-specific manual steps required to upgrade to 0.4-rc1, but you should make a habit of reading them anyway just to make sure. No-one likes a nasty surprise!</p>

<p>The upgrade.sh script attempts to backup the existing backend components, download new versions, and then run the hostmaster-migrate command. It assumes you are upgrading from the previous release (hostmaster-0.4-beta2). If you are not, you may have to edit the script to change the OLD_DRUPAL_DIR variable.</p>

<h2>No Drush 4 or Drush Make 2.0?</h2>

<p>Some people might be wondering why we haven't changed the install.sh
or upgrade.sh scripts to fetch the latest Drush 4.2 release or Drush
Make 2.0.</p>

<p><em>Drush</em></p>

<p>Drush 4.2 has a bug which breaks rsync and possibly other stuff when
using multiserver.</p>

<p>It's been fixed in Drush, but we are awaiting a 4.3 release before we
roll with it. If you see 4.3 come out, you can probably upgrade your
Drush if you wish (we tested this morning and are in fact compatible
with Drush HEAD at time of writing).</p>

<p>See this ticket for more: <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1041386" title="http://drupal.org/node/1041386">http://drupal.org/node/1041386</a></p>

<p><em>Drush Make</em></p>

<p>Drush Make 2.0 has a bug that prevents building platforms from
distributions that didn't come from drupal.org.</p>

<p>This has also been fixed in HEAD, but we are awaiting a 2.1 release
before we roll with it. If you see 2.1 come out, you can probably
upgrade your Drush Make if you wish.</p>

<p>See this ticket for more: <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1059238" title="http://drupal.org/node/1059238">http://drupal.org/node/1059238</a></p>

<p>We are working with the developers of these projects to attempt to
'sync' our releases in future, but we wanted to roll out rc1 to all
you good folk sooner rather than later this time :)</p>
