It's 3 basic steps::</p>

<ol>
<li>Install the <a href="../../../../17/index.html">system requirements</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../../390/index.html">Configure system requirements</a>, which include:

<ul>
<li>configure the <a href="../../../../390/index.html#Webserver_configuration">webserver</a>, <a href="../../../../390/index.html#Database_configuration">database</a>, <a href="../../../../390/index.html#DNS_configuration">DNS</a>, <a href="../../../../390/index.html#PHP_configuration">PHP</a>, etc</li>
<li>create an <a href="../../../../390/index.html#Creation_of_the_Aegir_user">Aegir user</a>,</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Install the backend (<a href="http://drupal.org/project/drush">Drush</a> &amp; <a href="http://drupal.org/project/provision">Provision</a>) and the frontend (with <code>hostmaster-install</code>) <a href="../../../../397/index.html">with install.sh</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that these instructions setup a complete Aegir system. If you want to only setup a new remote web/db server, it should be sufficient to install the <a href="../../../../17/index.html">system requirements</a> (step 1),  <a href="../../../../390/index.html">configure them</a> (step 2) and follow the <a href="../../../../30/index.html">Remote server how-to</a>.</p>

<p>These instructions provide example commands for a Debian-like distribution, but should be fairly easy to adapt to other environments. In fact, this document is meant as a canonical reference that should work on every platform and that can be used for people porting Aegir to new platforms or installing on alien platform for which Aegir is not yet packaged.</p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><h2><span class='diff-added'>What do I need to run Aegir?</span></h2><span class='diff-added'>

</span><dl><span class='diff-added'>
</span><dt><span class='diff-added'></span><strong><span class='diff-added'>A system capable of running Drupal</span></strong><span class='diff-added'></span></dt><span class='diff-added'>
</span><dd><span class='diff-added'>The Aegir system is entirely Drupal based, and has the same base requirements that Drupal does (with the exception that it won't run on Windows). See more notes on Unix and LAMP/LEMP requirements below.</span></dd><span class='diff-added'>

</span><dt><span class='diff-added'></span><strong><span class='diff-added'>Your own server</span></strong><span class='diff-added'></span></dt><span class='diff-added'>
</span><dd><span class='diff-added'>The low level of access required to be able to configure and run this system is very far beyond what is commonly available to users with shared hosting. A VPS from any popular provider such as Linode, Rackspace, Slicehost, Amazon EC, etc. will do fine.</span></dd><span class='diff-added'>

</span><dt><span class='diff-added'></span><strong><span class='diff-added'>LAMP / LEMP</span></strong><span class='diff-added'></span></dt><span class='diff-added'>
</span><dd><span class='diff-added'>LAMP / LEMP are used to run Aegir and provide the frontend interface, as well as provide those same tools to your managed sites. These components are further detailed in the following sections. While you can install Aegir alongside an existing LAMP installation, it is generally considered easier (and thus recommended) to start with a fresh server.</span></dd><span class='diff-added'>

</span><dd><span class='diff-added'>
</span><p><span class='diff-added'></span><strong><span class='diff-added'>N.B.:</span></strong><span class='diff-added'> If you do install Aegir alongside an existing server with LAMP/LEMP already configured, be aware that you will have to make configuration changes to Apache and MySQL where necessary, so that Aegir can work with your system.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>
</span></dd><span class='diff-added'>

</span><dt><span class='diff-added'></span><strong><span class='diff-added'>A Unix-based operating system</span></strong><span class='diff-added'></span></dt><span class='diff-added'>
</span><dd><span class='diff-added'>Aegir must run on some flavour of UNIX, because the majority of functionality in this system occurs in the back-end, through command line scripting. There are also several features (such as symlinks), that are not available to users on Windows. There are no plans currently to add Windows support.</span></dd><span class='diff-added'>

</span><dt><span class='diff-added'></span><strong><span class='diff-added'>Web server</span></strong><span class='diff-added'></span></dt><span class='diff-added'>
</span><dd><span class='diff-added'>You will need at least one dedicated web server, running Apache. We generally work with Apache 2 but we should be compatible with the 1.x series. You will need root access to that server and the server must be reserved for
Aegir. Sharing the server with other control panels such as Cpanel, Plesk or AlternC will very likely create problems and is not supported.</span></dd><span class='diff-added'>

</span><dd><span class='diff-added'>
</span><p><span class='diff-added'>Aegir also supports Nginx web server, but requires at least version 0.7.27 or newer. Since Nginx doesn't provide php-cgi or php-fpm (recommended) modules, you will need to install and run php-fpm server separately. You can find useful examples and tips in the third party Barracuda installer available at </span><a href="http://gitorious.org/aegir/barracuda-octopus" title="http://gitorious.org/aegir/barracuda-octopus"><span class='diff-added'>http://gitorious.org/aegir/barracuda-octopus</span></a><span class='diff-added'>.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>
</span></dd><span class='diff-added'>

</span><dd><span class='diff-added'>
</span><p><span class='diff-added'></span><strong><span class='diff-added'>N.B.:</span></strong><span class='diff-added'> This third party installer is not supported by the core Aegir developers, but you can find helpful community support at </span><a href="../../../../../index.html" title="http://community.aegirproject.org"><span class='diff-added'>http://community.aegirproject.org</span></a><span class='diff-added'>.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>
</span></dd><span class='diff-added'>

</span><dt><span class='diff-added'></span><strong><span class='diff-added'>Database server</span></strong><span class='diff-added'></span></dt><span class='diff-added'>
</span><dd><span class='diff-added'>You will require a database server, obviously. Aegir currently only supports MySQL and MariaDB. It is preferable to use a dedicated (not shared-hosting) server since Aegir will create database users and will require the use of the MySQL 'root' user.</span></dd><span class='diff-added'>

</span><dt><span class='diff-added'></span><strong><span class='diff-added'>PHP 5.2</span></strong><span class='diff-added'></span></dt><span class='diff-added'>
</span><dd><span class='diff-added'>PHP 5.2 and above is required to run Aegir because Aegir depends on </span><a href="http://drupal.org/project/drush"><span class='diff-added'>Drush</span></a><span class='diff-added'>, which has this requirement. You also need to have the command-line version of PHP to run Drush properly and the MySQL extensions.</span></dd><span class='diff-added'>

</span><dd><span class='diff-added'>
</span><p><span class='diff-added'>Note that Drupal's support for PHP 5.3 is still under development. Currently, using PHP 5.3 will cause (innocuous) warnings on every page load. As a result, we suggest using PHP 5.2 for the time-being.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>
</span></dd><span class='diff-added'>

</span><dd><span class='diff-added'>
</span><p><span class='diff-added'>See </span><a href="http://drupal.org/node/360605" title="http://drupal.org/node/360605"><span class='diff-added'>http://drupal.org/node/360605</span></a><span class='diff-added'> (amongst other issues) for details.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>
</span></dd><span class='diff-added'>

</span><dt><span class='diff-added'></span><strong><span class='diff-added'>Mail transfer agent</span></strong><span class='diff-added'></span></dt><span class='diff-added'>
</span><dd><span class='diff-added'>Aegir requires an MTA (Mail Transfer Agent) installed on your webserver in order to be able to install new sites to your new platform. If you don't have an MTA, the site installation will fail with message like "could not send email". Additional messages will show that site has been removed because of this problem. To remedy the situation simply install an MTA like sendmail, postfix, or exim and do the minimal configuration.</span></dd><span class='diff-added'>

</span><dt><span class='diff-added'></span><strong><span class='diff-added'>Other utilities: sudo, rsync, git and unzip</span></strong><span class='diff-added'></span></dt><span class='diff-added'>
</span><dd><span class='diff-added'>Aegir installs itself via a </span><a href="http://drupal.org/project/drush_make"><span class='diff-added'>Drush Make</span></a><span class='diff-added'> makefile that downloads via git if you want the bleeding edge code, or via wget if you want the latest official release. If you want the latest development version, and don't have the git program you
will need to install it on the server.</span></dd><span class='diff-added'>

</span><dd><span class='diff-added'>
</span><p><span class='diff-added'>The jQueryUI library is used in the Aegir UI, unzip is required to extract it. Sudo is required to allow the aegir user the limited privilege to restart the webserver when required.  Rsync is used to sync files to remote servers.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>
</span></dd><span class='diff-added'>

</span><dt><span class='diff-added'></span><strong><span class='diff-added'>No conflicting Control Panels</span></strong><span class='diff-added'></span></dt><span class='diff-added'>
</span><dd><span class='diff-added'>Other popular control panels such as Plesk, cPanel etc, are designed to manage all aspects of Apache configuration and other areas that Aegir also is intended to be used for.</span></dd><span class='diff-added'>

</span><dd><span class='diff-added'>
</span><p><span class='diff-added'>Running Aegir alongside such control panels is not supported and very likely may cause you problems or difficulties installing or running Aegir. This is not recommended. Filing bug reports that are caused by interference by another control panel may not get results. Proceed at your own risk / frustration!</span></p><span class='diff-added'>
</span></dd><span class='diff-added'>

</span><dt><span class='diff-added'></span><strong><span class='diff-added'>System requirements of popular Drupal distributions</span></strong><span class='diff-added'></span></dt><span class='diff-added'>
</span><dd><span class='diff-added'>Some Drupal distributions, such as OpenAtrium, are specialised products that may contain unique prerequisites for optimal performance. Such examples may include raising the php-cli program's memory_limit to something higher than 64M.</span></dd><span class='diff-added'>

</span><dd><span class='diff-added'>
</span><p><span class='diff-added'>Please note that this is not a requirement of Aegir but of the distribution you are trying to install a site on. Thus the Aegir documentation may not officially 'require' such performance settings, but be aware that Aegir may report errors if the system was under-resourced to complete such a task.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

      <p>A few points just on installing drush with RedHat 6 that I seem to run in to every time.</p>

<p>When I try to discover the pear channel as aegir user I get
<code>could not create lock file: fopen(/usr/share/pear/.lock): failed to open stream: Permission denied</code></p>

<p>I also get the following after I make the aegir user owner of the .lock file
<div class="codeblock"><code>pear channel-discover pear.drush.org<br />Discovering channel pear.drush.org over http:// failed with message: channel-add: adding Channel &quot;pear.drush.org&quot; to registry failed<br />Trying to discover channel pear.drush.org over https:// instead<br />Discovery of channel &quot;pear.drush.org&quot; failed (channel-add: Cannot open &quot;https://pear.drush.org/channel.xml&quot; (Connection to `pear.drush.org:443&#039; failed: Connection refused))</code></div></p>

<p>I can add it with root user but when installing drush I get <div class="codeblock"><code>pear install drush/drush-5.8.0<br />Cannot install, php_dir for channel &quot;pear.drush.org&quot; is not writeable by the current user</code></div></p>

<p>I always have to install drush as root and then modify ownership/permissions to aegir user. Is the documentation wrong, or am I missing something?</p>

<p>Also, for drush 5 it seems that 'http://download.pear.php.net/package/Console_Table-1.1.3.tgz' is a dependency!</p>    </div>
