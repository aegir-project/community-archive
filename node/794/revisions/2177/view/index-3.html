[22:00:17]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> hello people
[22:00:23]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> hello
[22:00:24]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> welcome to our morning weekly scrum
[22:00:29]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> hi
[22:00:30]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> hey univate what's up
[22:00:47]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> alright
[22:00:58]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> so i don't have much to say for myself - i am about to leave for a<span class='diff-added'> long leave
[22:01:12]</span>    whats that state of the D7 port?
[22:01:17]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> i will be in europe for two months and will rarely work on <span class='diff-changed'>computers,</span> if i can afford it :)
[22:01:27]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> i will be back on october 1st and will start again from there
[22:01:28]  * omega8cc_ has joined #aegir
[22:01:31]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> univate: i don't know! :)
[22:01:59]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> so our gsoc student is supposed to take care of that, but i didn't <span class='diff-changed'>get</span> any news from him since the evaluation
[22:02:02]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> which is really too bad
[22:02:06]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> i'll try to ping him by email now
[22:02:12]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> anarcat: please send me an email before you go, re GSOC student
[22:02:15]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> or cc me on that one ^^
[22:02:25]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> alright, i'll do this right away
[22:02:53]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> other than that, i think that's it for me
[22:03:17]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> nothing new from me, all my time atm is taken up by work and study
[22:03:59]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> alright, sounds like me except s/work and study/vacation/ ;)
[22:04:26]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> mig5: @gmail is okay?
[22:04:32]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> sure
[22:04:41]  * omega8cc has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[22:04:42]  * omega8cc_ is now known as omega8cc
[22:06:11]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> okay, anyone else?
[22:06:14]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> darthsteven: ping
[22:06:24]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> omega8cc: how are the cron jobs?
[22:07:03]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> anarcat: pong!
[22:07:07]  * Irishgringo has joined #aegir
[22:07:08]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> ha!
[22:07:12]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> darthsteven: anything for the scrum?
[22:07:20]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> darthsteven: we need to coordinate for the training and the<span class='diff-added'> session
[22:07:32]</span>    nothing for the scrum :(
[22:07:33]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> anarcat: it works great, but it should probably go in 1.3 no? as <span class='diff-changed'>it</span> is a critical for all users
[22:07:42]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> darthsteven: ok
[22:07:53]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> darthsteven: i'm leaving the internets for a while on the 1st, so <span class='diff-changed'>we</span> would need to coordinate this week... email?
[22:08:09]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> omega8cc: well, not for <span class='diff-changed'></span><em><span class='diff-changed'>all</span></em><span class='diff-changed'>,</span> the drush method works fine right?
[22:08:14]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> anarcat: sure
[22:08:39]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> yeah, so it is critical in 50% ;)
[22:08:40]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> okay
[22:08:53]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> i don't think i'll be making a 1.3 release now
[22:09:00]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> if someone else wants to, be my guest!
[22:09:16]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> as long as we have crush method as default, it is fine
[22:09:23]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> drush
[22:09:33]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> univate: so the d7 port is handled by seth.vincent's sandboxes on <span class='diff-changed'>drupal.org,</span> if you want to followup on that it would be great
[22:09:34]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> uh, Lion autocorrection is crazy
[22:11:17]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> anarcat: ok i will try and track down what is there
[22:11:37]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> univate: can you give me your mail addy again
[22:14:39]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> looks like seth.vincents last commits to his sandbox projects were <span class='diff-changed'>5</span> weeks ago
[22:15:34]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> quite possible
[22:15:41]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> he kinda stalled on the project at some point
[22:15:49]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> i'll push him again now
[22:18:33]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> so what's the next scrum time?
[22:18:50]  * welly has quit (Quit: Textual IRC Client: <a href="http://www.textualapp.com/" title="http://www.textualapp.com/"><span class='diff-added'>http://www.textualapp.com/</span></a><span class='diff-added'>)
[22:18:51] </span><span class='diff-changed'>  </span> i won't be coordinating the next ones until october 1st
[22:19:00]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> so we need someone to take that over, or we suspend those for a<span class='diff-added'> while
[22:19:54]</span>    I don't think we agreed on a new time, i'll coordinate with <span class='diff-changed'>darthsteven</span> / omega8cc
[22:20:12]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> if we can't agree on a good time we'll suspend them or rotate<span class='diff-added'> people
[22:20:20]</span>    ok
[22:20:26]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> or i'll move to europe :)
[22:20:34]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> :)
[22:21:23]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> it should be easy to find good time for EU/AU
[22:23:12]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> yeah
[22:24:20]  * jonhattan has quit (Quit: llevaré una chaquete de guns'n'roses)

[22:40:57]<span class='diff-added'>   </span> evening usually better for me
