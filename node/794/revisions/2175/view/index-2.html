[22:00:17]     hello people
[22:00:23]     hello
[22:00:24]     welcome to our morning weekly scrum
[22:00:29]    hi
[22:00:30]     hey univate what's up
[22:00:47]     alright
[22:00:58]     so i don't have much to say for myself - i am about to leave for a long leave
[22:01:12]     whats that state of the D7 port?
[22:01:17]     i will be in europe for two months and will rarely work on computers, if i can afford it :)
[22:01:27]     i will be back on october 1st and will start again from there
[22:01:28]  * omega8cc_ has joined #aegir
[22:01:31]     univate: i don't know! :)
[22:01:59]     so our gsoc student is supposed to take care of that, but i didn't get any news from him since the evaluation
[22:02:02]     which is really too bad
[22:02:06]     i'll try to ping him by email now
[22:02:12]    anarcat: please send me an email before you go, re GSOC student
[22:02:15]    or cc me on that one ^^
[22:02:25]     alright, i'll do this right away
[22:02:53]     other than that, i think that's it for me
[22:03:17]    nothing new from me, all my time atm is taken up by work and study
[22:03:59]     alright, sounds like me except s/work and study/vacation/ ;)
[22:04:26]     mig5: @gmail is okay?
[22:04:32]    sure
[22:04:41]  * omega8cc has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[22:04:42]  * omega8cc_ is now known as omega8cc
[22:06:11]     okay, anyone else?
[22:06:14]     darthsteven: ping
[22:06:24]     omega8cc: how are the cron jobs?
[22:07:03]     anarcat: pong!
[22:07:07]  * Irishgringo has joined #aegir
[22:07:08]     ha!
[22:07:12]     darthsteven: anything for the scrum?
[22:07:20]     darthsteven: we need to coordinate for the training and the session
[22:07:32]     nothing for the scrum :(
[22:07:33]    anarcat: it works great, but it should probably go in 1.3 no? as it is a critical for all users
[22:07:42]     darthsteven: ok
[22:07:53]     darthsteven: i'm leaving the internets for a while on the 1st, so we would need to coordinate this week... email?
[22:08:09]     omega8cc: well, not for <em>all</em>, the drush method works fine right?
[22:08:14]     anarcat: sure
[22:08:39]    yeah, so it is critical in 50% ;)
[22:08:40]     okay
[22:08:53]     i don't think i'll be making a 1.3 release now
[22:09:00]     if someone else wants to, be my guest!
[22:09:16]    as long as we have crush method as default, it is fine
[22:09:23]    drush
[22:09:33]     univate: so the d7 port is handled by seth.vincent's sandboxes on drupal.org, if you want to followup on that it would be great
[22:09:34]    uh, Lion autocorrection is crazy
[22:11:17]     anarcat: ok i will try and track down what is there
[22:11:37]     univate: can you give me your mail addy again
[22:14:39]     looks like seth.vincents last commits to his sandbox projects were 5 weeks ago
[22:15:34]     quite possible
[22:15:41]     he kinda stalled on the project at some point
[22:15:49]     i'll push him again now
[22:18:33]     so what's the next scrum time?
[22:18:50]  * welly has quit (Quit: Textual IRC Client: <a href="http://www.textualapp.com/" title="http://www.textualapp.com/">http://www.textualapp.com/</a>)
[22:18:51]     i won't be coordinating the next ones until october 1st
[22:19:00]     so we need someone to take that over, or we suspend those for a while
[22:19:54]    I don't think we agreed on a new time, i'll coordinate with darthsteven / omega8cc
[22:20:12]    if we can't agree on a good time we'll suspend them or rotate people
[22:20:20]     ok
[22:20:26]    or i'll move to europe :)
[22:20:34]    :)
[22:21:23]    it should be easy to find good time for EU/AU
[22:23:12]    yeah
[22:24:20]  * jonhattan has quit (Quit: llevaré una chaquete de guns'n'roses)
[22:24:52]     there was a time proposal here: <a href="../../../../../discuss/new-scrum-time-our-gsoc-student/index.html" title="http://community.aegirproject.org/discuss/new-scrum-time-our-gsoc-student">http://community.aegirproject.org/discuss/new-scrum-time-our-gsoc-student</a>
[22:28:50]    mig5: what time works best for you? morning, evening?
[22:36:42]  * Egyptian[Laptop] has joined #aegir
[22:40:17]    so maybe <a href="http://bit.ly/qGhjDr" title="http://bit.ly/qGhjDr">http://bit.ly/qGhjDr</a> ?
[22:40:57]    evening usually better for me
[22:41:13]    7, 8 or 9 pm?
[22:41:23]    8 or 9 is fine, that link above is fine with me
[22:41:27]    let's see what darthsteven says
[22:41:31]    k
[22:41:36]     mig5: ping

[22:44:06]    that's quite good! when did that appear
[22:44:06]  * scientist has joined #aegir
[22:45:18]     i just wrote it
[22:45:42]    nice
[22:45:51]    some of that would be good in the wikipedia page
[22:46:12]    (for those of you who missed it: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegir_Hosting_System" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegir_Hosting_System">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegir_Hosting_System</a> )
[22:46:19]     yeah, that's why i wrote it
[22:46:58]    :)
[22:47:23]  * Irishgringo has quit (Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.87 [Firefox 5.0.1/20110707182747])
[22:47:47]    nice!
[22:48:30]    in other news, i rejoined twitter, and now feel dirty
[22:49:28]    and am studying for my OSCP, so if you find I discover any XSS or other holes in aegir, you know why :) <a href="http://www.offensive-security.com/online-information-security-training/p" title="http://www.offensive-security.com/online-information-security-training/p">http://www.offensive-security.com/online-information-security-training/p</a>...
[22:50:22]  * scottalan has joined #aegir
[22:51:02]     mig5, omega8cc: 10AM UTC is fine with me
[22:52:07]    mig5: I already grabbed that book about security thanks to your tweets, so it is a good thing (™)
[22:54:18]    darthsteven, mig5: so let's change the scrum time to <a href="http://bit.ly/qGhjDr" title="http://bit.ly/qGhjDr">http://bit.ly/qGhjDr</a> then for the summer
[22:54:31]     agreed</p></div>    </div>
