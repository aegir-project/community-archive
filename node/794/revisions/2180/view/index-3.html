coordinate</span> for the training and the <span class='diff-changed'>session [22:07:32]</span> nothing for the scrum<span class='diff-deleted'> </span><span class='diff-deleted'>:(
[22:07:33]</span>  <span class='diff-changed'>
:( [22:07:33]</span> anarcat: it works great, but it should probably go in 1.3 no? <span class='diff-changed'> 
as</span> it is a critical for all <span class='diff-changed'>users [22:07:42]</span> darthsteven: <span class='diff-changed'>ok [22:07:53]</span>  <span class='diff-changed'>
darthsteven:</span> i'm leaving the internets for a while on the 1st, so we would <span class='diff-changed'> 
need</span> to coordinate this week... <span class='diff-changed'>email? [22:08:09]</span> omega8cc: well, not for <span class='diff-changed'>

yeah,</span> so it is critical in 50% <span class='diff-changed'>;) [22:08:40] okay [22:08:53]</span> i don't think <span class='diff-changed'> 
i'll</span> be making a 1.3 release <span class='diff-changed'>now [22:09:00]</span> if someone else wants to, be my<span class='diff-deleted'> </span><span class='diff-deleted'>guest!
[22:09:16]</span>  <span class='diff-changed'>
guest! [22:09:16]</span> as long as we have crush method as default, it is <span class='diff-changed'>fine</span>  <span class='diff-changed'>
[22:09:23] drush [22:09:33]</span> univate: so the d7 port is handled by <span class='diff-changed'> 
seth.vincent's</span> sandboxes on drupal.org, if you want to followup on that it <span class='diff-changed'> 
would</span> be <span class='diff-changed'>great [22:09:34]</span> uh, Lion autocorrection is <span class='diff-changed'>crazy [22:11:17]</span>  <span class='diff-changed'>

you</span> give me your mail addy <span class='diff-changed'>again [22:14:39]</span> looks like seth.vincents last <span class='diff-changed'> 
commits</span> to his sandbox projects were 5 weeks <span class='diff-changed'>ago [22:15:34]</span> quite <span class='diff-changed'>possible</span>  <span class='diff-changed'>

won't</span> be coordinating the next ones until october <span class='diff-changed'>1st [22:19:00]</span> so we need <span class='diff-changed'> 
someone</span> to take that over, or we suspend those for a <span class='diff-changed'>while [22:19:54]</span> I don't <span class='diff-changed'> 
think</span> we agreed on a new time, i'll coordinate with darthsteven / <span class='diff-changed'>omega8cc</span>  <span class='diff-changed'>
[22:20:12]</span> if we can't agree on a good time we'll suspend them or rotate<span class='diff-deleted'> </span><span class='diff-deleted'>people
