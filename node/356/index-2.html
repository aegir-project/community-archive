07:00 &lt;@anarcat&gt; so welcome to our weekly scrum
07:01 -!- JoshBenner_ [~quassel@pool-173-59-14-26.phlapa.fios.verizon.net] has joined #aegir
07:01 &lt;@anarcat&gt; so to start with - i had a major fuckup with the community site with a verify that went bad
07:01 &lt;@anarcat&gt; because the alias didn't have the profile set in
07:01 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i documented all this in here <a href="../355/index.html" title="http://community.aegirproject.org/node/355">http://community.aegirproject.org/node/355</a>
07:01 &lt;@mig5&gt; reading that now. why did oyu need to manually run provision-deploy rather than standard migrate?
07:02 &lt;@anarcat&gt; mig5: because the site wasn't in aegir at first
07:02 &lt;@mig5&gt; gotcha
07:02 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i was importing from devseed
07:02 &lt;@mig5&gt; oh ofcourse *slaps forehead*
07:02 &lt;@anarcat&gt; maybe i should clarify that.. but anyways
07:02 &lt;@mig5&gt; no i'm just a dick and just woke up :)
07:02 &lt;@anarcat&gt; other than that, this week i have struggled with the issue queue
07:02 &lt;@mig5&gt; +1...
07:03 &lt;@anarcat&gt; specificall with that eugene guy which apparently decided we were evil and decided to develop his own stuff privately and stop collaborating on the queue
07:03 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i wrote a response in the issue queue, but i wanted to share here that it pissed me off real bad to hear somebody just go away like this because we're not being nice enough
07:03 &lt;@anarcat&gt; when he's treating us with abuse and duplicate issues
07:04 &lt;@anarcat&gt; hopefully he will not come back to the queue but share his work with others so that we don't reinvent the wheel
07:04 &lt;@anarcat&gt; one of those duplicate issues is this: <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1058918" title="http://drupal.org/node/1058918">http://drupal.org/node/1058918</a>
07:05 &lt;@mig5&gt; his hosting_folders feature was just wrong anyway
07:05 &lt;@anarcat&gt; apparently eugene had a contrib module to fix this, but because i marked his issue as duplicate of mine, he got angry and removed his code from github
07:05 &lt;@anarcat&gt; but anyways, we talked about this vhost customization thing, and people were suggesting that it should be in contrib, but i feel like i disagree - if it's safe, it could be in core couldn't it?
07:05 &lt;@mig5&gt; the subfolder stuff?
07:06 &lt;@anarcat&gt; no no
07:06 &lt;@anarcat&gt; <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1058918" title="http://drupal.org/node/1058918">http://drupal.org/node/1058918</a>
07:06 &lt;@anarcat&gt; the custom vhost stuff
07:06 &lt;@mig5&gt; ah
07:06 &lt;+omega8cc&gt; in core, imo
07:06 &lt;@anarcat&gt; right
07:06 &lt; eft_&gt; anarcat: that's moving vhost config  into front end?
07:07 -!- Artusamak is now known as Artusamak_afk
07:07 &lt;@anarcat&gt; so anyways, that's about it for me - i'll try to work more on the issue queue and make an RC during next week unless there are objections here
07:07 &lt;@anarcat&gt; eft_: no
07:07 &lt;@anarcat&gt; mig5: next!
07:07 &lt; eft_&gt; anarcat: that's great that you migrated c.a.o. - do we still need the 1700 EST downtime in the header of this channel
07:07 &lt;@anarcat&gt; eft_: no
07:07 -!- anarcat changed the topic of #aegir to: Aegir hosting system 0.4-beta2 released! <a href="../../0/index-2.html" title="http://community.aegirproject.org/0.4-beta2">http://community.aegirproject.org/0.4-beta2</a> | Issue queue: <a href="http://is.gd/edalY" title="http://is.gd/edalY">http://is.gd/edalY</a> | read this before asking: <a href="../../bugs/index.html" title="http://community.aegirproject.org/bugs">http://community.aegirproject.org/bugs</a> | scrums on thursdays 2000UTC
07:08 &lt;@mig5&gt; i've done nothing all week due to some hectic work and basically some of our users killing my love for the project.
07:08 &lt;@mig5&gt; i fixed a minor bug here or there
07:08 &lt;@mig5&gt; and will likewise attack the queue some more, i think we should rc soonor we'll just be forever trying to battle that
07:08 &lt;@anarcat&gt; yeah
07:08 &lt;@anarcat&gt; agreed
07:09 &lt;@mig5&gt; that's it from me
07:09 &lt;@anarcat&gt; seems like the only blocker is the ssl rollback, which we could roll into another rc
07:09  * eft_ wishes he had more to offer than nitpicks about channel headers
07:09 -!- Artusamak_afk is now known as Artusamak
07:09 &lt;@anarcat&gt; let's just RC the fucking thing
07:09 &lt;@anarcat&gt; mig5: if you feel like it - just do it, and ignore the issue queue ;)
07:09 &lt; eft_&gt; mig5: any progress on your workflow diags?
07:09 &lt;@anarcat&gt; eft_: you can fight with trolls in the issue queue and get them off our backs :)
07:09 &lt;+omega8cc&gt; go with RC - to avoid "one more thing" syndrome == release 3 years later ;)
07:09 &lt;@anarcat&gt; there's a lot of triage work that is needed in the queue, that mostly anyone could do
07:09 &lt;@mig5&gt; eft_: that was just for a client proposal, it wasn't very good, <a href="http://greenbeedigital.com.au/files/aegir_workflow.jpg" title="http://greenbeedigital.com.au/files/aegir_workflow.jpg">http://greenbeedigital.com.au/files/aegir_workflow.jpg</a>
07:10 &lt;@anarcat&gt; mig5: anything else?
07:10 &lt;@mig5&gt; anarcat: nope, that's it, i might release today then if i get time
07:10 &lt; eft_&gt; anarcat: bon cop, bad cop
07:10 &lt;@anarcat&gt; eft_: ouaip :)
07:10 &lt;@anarcat&gt; Vertice / adrinux / darthsteven / grugnog / mvc / omega8cc / sfyn / ergonlogic / univate_: anybody else got something to add to our scrum?
07:10 &lt;@anarcat&gt; mig5: that would be just amazing :)
07:10 &lt;+omega8cc&gt; not much from me this week, I only made barracuda/octopus compatible with Debian 6 and Ubuntu 10.10 plus some new fixes for Nginx config
07:11 &lt;@anarcat&gt; okay, anyone else?
07:11 &lt;+ergonlogic&gt; nothing from me
07:11 &lt;+omega8cc&gt; hope to work on contrib module for solr cores automatic setup - integrated with skwashd work
07:11 &lt;@anarcat&gt; univate_: thanks for those patches, btw, keep em coming!
07:11 &lt;@anarcat&gt; omega8cc: that would be freakin awesome!
07:12 &lt;@anarcat&gt; omega8cc: we got config for secure multi-core setups if you're interested... in our wiki
07:12 &lt;+omega8cc&gt; yep
07:12 &lt;@mig5&gt; anarcat: would love a review of <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1005014" title="http://drupal.org/node/1005014">http://drupal.org/node/1005014</a>
07:12 &lt;@mig5&gt; (re:univate)
07:12 &lt;@anarcat&gt; mig5: got it, maybe tomorrow
07:12 &lt;@anarcat&gt; mig5: but don't wait for this to rc
07:12 &lt;@mig5&gt; ok
07:12 &lt;+omega8cc&gt; anarcat: I will check that, thanks!
07:12 &lt;@anarcat&gt; okay, anyone else?
07:13 &lt;+ergonlogic&gt; now that community.aegirproject.org is hosted at Koumbit, I could help if there's any issues with the site itself
07:13 &lt;+ergonlogic&gt; just let me know
07:13 &lt;@mig5&gt; eft_: wanted thesession_timeout something or other to be raised
07:13 &lt;@mig5&gt; so that it remembers you're loged in
07:13 &lt;@mig5&gt; logged* bah.
07:13 &lt;@anarcat&gt; ergonlogic: yeah, i think mig5 had issues with some images you could help with
07:13 &lt;@anarcat&gt; mig5: ^?
07:14 &lt;@mig5&gt; which images?
07:14 &lt;@anarcat&gt; mig5: i don't recall
07:14 &lt;@anarcat&gt; istr there was some thumbnail problem... wasn't there?
07:14 &lt;@mig5&gt; oh yes
07:14 &lt; eft_&gt; yea
07:14 &lt;@mig5&gt; possibly an atrium bug or something weird
07:14 &lt;@anarcat&gt; yeah
07:14 &lt;@mig5&gt; <a href="../76/index.html" title="http://community.aegirproject.org/node/76">http://community.aegirproject.org/node/76</a>
07:14 &lt;@anarcat&gt; well now we have root, so let us know what we need to do :)
07:14 &lt;@mig5&gt; the href to that is the full size image, but it *always* loads the thumbnail
07:14 &lt;@anarcat&gt; ergonlogic can take care of it or i can help
07:14 &lt;+ergonlogic&gt; ok, I'll take a look
07:15 &lt;@anarcat&gt; okay, i gotta go
07:15 &lt;@anarcat&gt; and the scrum is over, thanks for attending, people!
07:15 &lt;@anarcat&gt; and have a nice day
07:15 &lt;@mig5&gt; cheers
