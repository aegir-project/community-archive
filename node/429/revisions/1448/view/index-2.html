</span><h1><span class='diff-added'>Conventions </span><span class='diff-changed'>&amp; Tips</span></h1><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>All instructions and in general all commands must be run as aegir user, so all
permissions are always set correctly.</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>To become aegir user you can issue this command::</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><pre><span class='diff-changed'></span><code><span class='diff-changed'>su -s /bin/sh aegir
</span></code><span class='diff-changed'></span></pre><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>(Note you must run this as root or prefix with sudo).</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>Note that /bin/sh is an example. You may wish to instead use</span> the <span class='diff-changed'>shell</span> of<span class='diff-added'> your
choice, i.e /bin/bash</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>A standard umask of 022 is assumed. This is the default on most systems.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><h1><span class='diff-added'>Setting Environment Variables</span></h1><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>To make following instructions generic and not dependant on a
concrete Drupal or Aegir version, we will use shell environment
variables. Since 0.4, the hostmaster platform is prepended with 'hostmaster'
so as not to clash with any other Drupal platforms. If you are upgrading from
Aegir version 0.3, your hostmaster platform may be called 'drupal-6.14'.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>You should replace the following variables for current versions at the time
you are reading</span> this <span class='diff-changed'>document.</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>Shell commands::</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><pre><span class='diff-changed'></span><code><span class='diff-changed'>export AEGIR_VERSION="6.x-1.0-rc3"
export AEGIR_HOME="$HOME"
export DRUPAL_DIR=$AEGIR_HOME/hostmaster-$AEGIR_VERSION
export DRUSH_VERSION=7.x-4.4
export DRUSH_MAKE_VERSION=6.x-2.2
export AEGIR_DOMAIN=aegir.example.com
export OLD_DRUPAL_DIR=$AEGIR_HOME/hostmaster-6.x-1.0-rc2
</span></code><span class='diff-changed'></span></pre><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>This document also assumes drush is installed properly and we use an
environment variable to simplify the documentation again.</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>Shell commands::</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><pre><span class='diff-changed'></span><code><span class='diff-changed'>export DRUSH="php $AEGIR_HOME/drush/drush.php"
</span></code><span class='diff-changed'></span></pre><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><h1><span class='diff-changed'>Upgrading the backend</span></h1><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>In general, we try to keep the backend and the frontend compatible with each
other during release cycles. That is: provision 0.3 and hosting 0.3 will
always be able to talk to each other. hosting 0.2 was able to talk to
provision 0.3 too, but the API is not well enough defined so that can be
counted upon.</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>Therefore, you want to keep the frontend and the backend in sync. When you do
a major upgrade (e.g. 0.3 -&gt; 0.4) of the backend, you </span><em><span class='diff-changed'>must</span></em><span class='diff-changed'> upgrade the
frontend soon after.</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>Bottomline: first you upgrade the backend, then the frontend.</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>Upgrading the backend is as simple as installing a new version of Drush and
Provision over the old ones.</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>Keep a copy of the old Provision and Drush in case something goes wrong in the
frontend.</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>Shell commands::</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><pre><span class='diff-changed'></span><code><span class='diff-changed'>cd $AEGIR_HOME
mv drush drush.bak
wget http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/drush-$DRUSH_VERSION.tar.gz 
gunzip -c drush-$DRUSH_VERSION.tar.gz | tar -xf -
rm drush-$DRUSH_VERSION.tar.gz
cd $HOME/.drush
mv provision ../provision.bak
wget http://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/provision-6.x-$AEGIR_VERSION.tar.gz
gunzip -c provision-6.x-$AEGIR_VERSION.tar.gz | tar -xf -
rm provision-6.x-$AEGIR_VERSION.tar.gz
</span></code><span class='diff-changed'></span></pre><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>Provision 0.4 has added a new dependency on drush_make, which will also need
to be installed to upgrade the front end if you are upgrading from a pre-0.4
release.</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>If you are upgrading from an earlier 0.4 release, replace your copy of
drush_make with the latest recommended release.</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>Shell commands::</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><pre><span class='diff-changed'></span><code><span class='diff-changed'>$DRUSH dl drush_make-$DRUSH_MAKE_VERSION --destination="$HOME/.drush"
</span></code><span class='diff-changed'></span></pre><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><h1><span class='diff-changed'>Upgrading the frontend</span></h1><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>These are generic instructions to upgrade your hosting, hostmaster, eldir or
Drupal core installation to new versions. As of 0.4 this process has largely
been automated, and will be able to upgrade 0.3 and any of the 0.4 development
releases to the latest applicable versions.</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>Once you have upgraded the backend, and you have installed drush_make you will
need to run the hostmaster migrate command.</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>Shell commands::</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><pre><span class='diff-changed'></span><code><span class='diff-changed'>cd $OLD_DRUPAL_DIR
$DRUSH hostmaster-migrate $AEGIR_DOMAIN $DRUPAL_DIR
</span></code><span class='diff-changed'></span></pre><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>The directory specified must be an absolute path to where you want the new
release to be stored. If the directory does not exist, provision will use
drush_make to fetch and assemble the correct version of the front end</span> for <span class='diff-changed'>the
specific release of the backend you are running.</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>This command will completely replace the crontab entry for the aegir user, and
asks for confirmation before it does so. If you do not confirm, the process
will be halted as it is necessary for the task queue to be processed.</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>The command above will fetch the latest stable Drupal release, so it can
simply be run again when a new security release of Drupal is made available.</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>If you have customized your Aegir installation and are maintaining your own
makefile, you can use the --makefile flag so the platform is created with
another makefile than the default. Be warned that this may create problems if
the makefile doesn't include the right Aegir modules.</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><h1><span class='diff-changed'>Version-specific upgrade notes</span></h1><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><h2><span class='diff-changed'>Bleeding-edge HEAD dependency</span></h2><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>If you intend on upgrading your system to the bleeding edge version of the
code from our git repositories, you will need the git program installed.  On
Debian, this means:</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>Shell commands:</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><pre><span class='diff-changed'></span><code><span class='diff-changed'>apt-get install git-core
</span></code><span class='diff-changed'></span></pre><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><h2><span class='diff-changed'>0.4 - DNS Configuration</span></h2><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>Aegir requires that the hostname returned by the </span><code><span class='diff-changed'>hostname</span></code><span class='diff-changed'> and </span><code><span class='diff-changed'>uname -n</span></code><span class='diff-changed'>
shell commands, resolves to the IP address for this server.</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>Shell commands as root:</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><pre><span class='diff-changed'></span><code><span class='diff-changed'>AEGIR_HOST=`uname -n`
resolveip $AEGIR_HOST
</span></code><span class='diff-changed'></span></pre><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>If the command returns your IP address, you are all set. If it returns
an error you will need to edit your </span><code><span class='diff-changed'>/etc/hosts</span></code><span class='diff-changed'> file.</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>(Mac OSX  notes: if you are running on OS X you will not likely have a resolveip  binary.  Just substitute 
  </span><code><span class='diff-changed'>ping $AEGIR_HOST</span></code><span class='diff-changed'>
).</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>First line of this file looks like:</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>127.0.0.1  localhost</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>Simply add all domains you want to this line. e.g:</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>127.0.0.1  localhost $AEGIR_HOST $AEGIR_DOMAIN other1 other2</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>To be clear you cannot put $AEGIR_HOST $AEGIR_DOMAIN  in your  hosts file.  Put in whatever  uname -n  returns  for $AEGIR_HOST and what ever  domain you want to use  f or  $AEGIR_DOMAIN  (real  domaion or faked in hosts file).   In OS X     uname -n will return whatever you put in  System  Preferences -&gt; Shareing -&gt; Computer Name.  I added that value  (iMac 27  for me) to /etc/hosts and my faked aegir  domain  as follows:</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'></span><code><span class='diff-changed'>127.0.0.1&nbsp; localhost&nbsp; iMac27&nbsp; aegir.local </span></code><span class='diff-changed'></span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>If you only intend to use Aegir on a single server, it is acceptable for
the resolved IP address to be the '127.0.0.1' loopback address.</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>If you intend to manage multiple servers using Aegir, you will need to
make sure that the IP address is the public IP of this server.</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>Finally, set an $AEGIR_IP environment variable for use in the Database
configuration step below.</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>Shell commands as root::
    AEGIR_IP=</span><code><span class='diff-changed'>resolveip $AEGIR_HOST | awk {'print $6'}</span></code><span class='diff-changed'></span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>(If running  OS X  or are otherwise missing  resolveip   and you just want to use Aegir on your computer use  you can do this:
AEGIR_IP=127.0.0.1</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><h2><span class='diff-changed'>0.4 - unzip dependency</span></h2><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>As of the 0.4-alpha3 release, 'unzip' is a required dependency on your server
in order to successfully extract the jquery.ui library that is part of some UI
improvements. On Debian, this means:</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>Shell commands::</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>apt-get install unzip</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><h2><span class='diff-changed'>0.4 - Database configuration</span></h2><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>To make sure that the Aegir backend, and all the possible web servers can
reach your database server, you need to configure mysql to listen on all
the public IP addresses available to it.</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>/etc/mysql/my.cnf configuration line to comment out::
    bind-address    = 127.0.0.1</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>Now you need to restart mysql, to clear any caches.</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>Shell command as root::
    /etc/init.d/mysql restart</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>Because you have already installed Aegir when it was using the generic grants,
you will need to create new grants using the public IP address and hostname
of this server.</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>Shell command ::
    mysql -uroot -p mysql</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>You need to generate the following grants using the hostname returned by the
</span><code><span class='diff-changed'>uname -n</span></code><span class='diff-changed'> command, and the IP address that the </span><code><span class='diff-changed'>resolveip</span></code><span class='diff-changed'> command returns
for that hostname.</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>You need to re-use the pasword you had for the account before.</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>Shell commands::</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><pre><span class='diff-changed'></span><code><span class='diff-changed'>mysql -u root -p -e "GRANT ALL ON *.* to 'aegir_root'@'$AEGIR_HOST' IDENTIFIED BY 'xxxx' WITH GRANT OPTION;"
mysql -u root -p -e "GRANT ALL ON *.* to 'aegir_root'@'$AEGIR_IP' IDENTIFIED BY 'xxxx' WITH GRANT OPTION;"
</span></code><span class='diff-changed'></span></pre><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><h2><span class='diff-changed'>0.4 - Apache configuration</span></h2><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>This release introduces multi-server support and required reorganizing
the Apache configuration files in ~aegir/config. Instead of having all
files in config/vhost.d, they are now split between vhost.d, platform.d
and a single apache.conf. The vhost.d directory is for virtual hosts,
platform.d is for platform-specific configuration and apache.conf is the
server-wide configuration file.</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>You will need to change the line you added to either the httpd.conf file 
or /etc/apache2/conf.d/aegir file during installation.</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>Open your httpd.conf file and modify::</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><pre><span class='diff-changed'></span><code><span class='diff-changed'>Include /var/aegir/config/vhost.d
</span></code><span class='diff-changed'></span></pre><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>To read ::</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><pre><span class='diff-changed'></span><code><span class='diff-changed'>Include /var/aegir/config/apache.conf
</span></code><span class='diff-changed'></span></pre><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>If you are upgrading from 0.4 releases between alpha8 and (including) alpha14,
you will need to rename your conf.d directory to post.d in Apache and pre.d in
Nginx. Example, in Apache::</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>mv /var/aegir/config/server_master/apache/{conf.d,post.d}</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>Now log into Aegir, and verify the hostmaster platform. This will generate
the correct apache.conf file and restart Apache.</span></p></div>    </div>
