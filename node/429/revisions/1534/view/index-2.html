<p>All instructions and in general all commands must be run as aegir user, so all
permissions are always set correctly.</p>

<p>To become aegir user you can issue this command::</p>

<pre><code>su -s /bin/sh aegir
</code></pre>

<p>(Note you must run this as root or prefix with sudo).</p>

<p>Note that /bin/sh is an example. You may wish to instead use the shell of your
choice, i.e /bin/bash</p>

<p>A standard umask of 022 is assumed. This is the default on most systems.</p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>We assume that drush is in your path, if it is installed in </span><code><span class='diff-added'>/var/aegir/drush/drush.php</span></code><span class='diff-added'>, replace all occurences of </span><code><span class='diff-added'>drush</span></code><span class='diff-added'> by </span><code><span class='diff-added'>/var/aegir/drush/drush.php</span></code><span class='diff-added'> in the following steps, or add the following alias:</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span></code><span class='diff-added'></span></pre>

<p><span class='diff-changed'>As part of your Aegir upgrade, you usually also upgrade Drush to the latest stable version.</span> Since <span class='diff-changed'>drush</span> is <span class='diff-changed'>capable of upgrading itself, you can just run:</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><pre><span class='diff-changed'></span><code><span class='diff-changed'>drush dl </span><span class='diff-added'>drush
</span></code><span class='diff-added'></span></pre><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p>If you are <span class='diff-changed'>using Debian packages, the package should</span> be <span class='diff-changed'>upgraded through apt-get.</span></p>

<p><span class='diff-changed'>Provision 0.4 has added a new dependency on drush_make, which will also need to be installed to upgrade the front end if you are upgrading from a pre-0.4 release.</span></p>

<p><span class='diff-changed'>If you are upgrading from an earlier 0.4 release, replace your copy of drush_make with</span> the <span class='diff-changed'>latest recommended release.</span></p>

<p>Shell commands::</p>

<pre><code><span class='diff-changed'>drush dl drush_make-6.x-2.2 --destination="$HOME/.drush"
</span></code></pre>

<div class="toc-back-to-top"><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></div><h1 id="Upgrading_the_backend">3. Upgrading the backend</h1>

<p>After your environment  variables are exported, you must then proceed to upgrade the backend. The reason for upgrading the backend first before the frontend, is that the frontend upgrade process is instigated by the backend using Drush Make. Thus you need to be running the new backend first in order to successfully produce a new frontend.</p>

<p>In general, we try to keep the backend and the frontend compatible with each other during release cycles. That is: provision 0.3 and hosting 0.3 will always be able to talk to each other. hosting 0.2 was able to talk to provision 0.3 too, but the API is not well enough defined so that can be counted upon.</p>

<p>Therefore, you want to keep the frontend and the backend in sync. When you do a major upgrade (e.g. 0.3 -&gt; 0.4) of the backend, you <em>must</em> upgrade the frontend soon after.</p>

<p>Bottomline: first you upgrade the backend, then the frontend.</p>

<p>Upgrading the backend is as simple as replacing your copy of Drush, Provision, and if necessary, Drush Make, with the new versions if available. Keep a copy of the old Provision and Drush in case something goes wrong in the frontend.</p><span class='diff-deleted'>

<div class="toc-back-to-top"><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></div><h1 id="Upgrading_the_frontend">4. Upgrading the frontend</h1>

<p>Once your backend is upgraded, you can upgrade your frontend. Think of this as the backend fetching a new copy of Drupal core and the Hostmaster frontend application onto your server, and then moving the Aegir site's settings.php and other bits and pieces over to the new codebase.</p>

<p>The procedure for upgrading the frontend is entering your old hostmaster directory, (say, <code>/var/aegir/hostmaster-$old-version</code>) and running 'drush hostmaster-migrate $youraegirdomain.com'.</p>

<p>Shell commands::</p>

<pre><code>cd <span class='diff-changed'>$OLD_AEGIR_DIR
drush</span> hostmaster-migrate <span class='diff-changed'>aegir.example.com $HOME/hostmaster-$AEGIR_VERSION
</span></code></pre><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>In the above you </span><strong><span class='diff-added'>must</span></strong><span class='diff-added'> replace the arguments to "cd" and "drush" to match your configuration. This means replacing </span><code><span class='diff-added'>aegir.example.com</span></code><span class='diff-added'> by the URL of your Aegir install, </span><code><span class='diff-added'>$AEGIR_VERSION</span></code><span class='diff-added'> with the version number of the Aegir you are trying to install (e.g. </span><code><span class='diff-added'>6.x-1.0-rc6</span></code><span class='diff-added'>), and also </span><code><span class='diff-added'>$OLD_AEGIR_DIR</span></code><span class='diff-added'> with the path to the previous directory where Aegir was installed (e.g. </span><code><span class='diff-added'>hostmaster-6.x-1.0-rc5</span></code><span class='diff-added'>).</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>Since 0.4, the hostmaster platform is prepended with 'hostmaster'
so as not to clash with any other Drupal platforms. If you are upgrading from Aegir version 0.3, your hostmaster platform may be called 'drupal-6.14'.</span></p>

<p>The directory specified must be an absolute path to where you want the <span class='diff-changed'>new release</span> to be stored. If the directory does not exist, provision will <span class='diff-changed'>use drush_make</span> to fetch and assemble the correct version of the front end for <span class='diff-changed'>the specific</span> release of the backend you are running.</p>

<p>This command will completely replace the crontab entry for the aegir user, <span class='diff-changed'>and asks</span> for confirmation before it does so. If you do not confirm, the <span class='diff-changed'>process will</span> be halted as it is necessary for the task queue to be processed.</p>

<p>The command above will fetch the latest stable Drupal release, so it <span class='diff-changed'>can simply</span> be run again when a new security release of Drupal is made available.</p>

<p>If you have customized your Aegir installation and are maintaining your <span class='diff-changed'>own makefile,</span> you can use the --makefile flag so the platform is created <span class='diff-changed'>with another</span> makefile than the default. Be warned that this may create problems <span class='diff-changed'>if the</span> makefile doesn't include the right Aegir modules.</p><div class="toc-back-to-top"><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></div><script type="text/javascript">toc_scroll_back_to_top = 1;</script></div>    </div>
