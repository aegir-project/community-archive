<p>Since Aegir has multi-server support, it is possible that you have a misconfigured "FQDN" and that aegir then tries to connect to the local server as a remote server. To check if you have a misconfigured server, run the following commands:</p>

<pre><code>resolveip `uname -n`
</code></pre>

<p>If the command returns your IP address, you are all set. If it returns an error you will need to edit your <code>/etc/hosts</code> file.</p>

<p>First line of this file looks like:</p>

<pre><code>127.0.0.1  localhost
</code></pre>

<p>Simply add all domains you want to this line. e.g:</p>

<pre><code>127.0.0.1  localhost aegir.example.com example.com
</code></pre>

<div class="toc-back-to-top"><span class='diff-changed'></span><a href="#toc"><span class='diff-changed'>Back to top</span></a><span class='diff-changed'></span></div><span class='diff-changed'></span><h2 id="NameVirtualHost_:80_has_no_VirtualHosts"><span class='diff-changed'>2. </span>NameVirtualHost *:80 has no VirtualHosts</h2>

<p>It does not hurt anything, but it can be annoying in your logs.  This may disappear as soon as you define your first virtual site using Aegir. If it does not, you most likely have a second NameVirtualHost statement in your configuration someplace other than in the Aegir configurations.</p>

<p>If you are on a Debian system, that is usually a configuration fragment in /etc/apache2/ports.conf or in a fragment symbolically linked in /etc/apache2/sites-enabled and it is safe to comment out any NameVirtualHost statements you find there as this really is a large part of the job you have asked Aegir to do for you.</p>

<p>Once those are commented out, the message should disappear.</p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><div class="toc-back-to-top"><span class='diff-added'></span><a href="#toc"><span class='diff-added'>Back to top</span></a><span class='diff-added'></span></div><span class='diff-added'></span><h2 id="Making_sure_it_works"><span class='diff-added'>3. Making sure it works</span></h2><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>Your new Aegir server will be installed with a single site named the way you specified in your install script.  That's great, but you may have more paths to that same server.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>When you try to browse to your server for the first time from a non-localhost browser you may get an addressing issue.  If you do, make sure that you actually have the server defined in DNS and that the DNS server was reloaded.  If it was reloaded and you use slave servers, make sure that the serial number in the zone file was incremented so that the slaves automatically reload.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>If you already have multiple URLs in your DNS which resolve to the same Aegir, you should check them.  For instance: if your DNS resolves both aegir.example.com and sitecontrol.example.com to your new Aegir server's IP, you need to make sure that both are accommodated.  If they will both get the same physical hostmaster site, one should be set up as an alias to the other.  If they are indeed going to be separate sites you will have to create a new site node with the other name as a virtual site.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><div class="toc-back-to-top"><span class='diff-added'></span><a href="#toc"><span class='diff-added'>Back to top</span></a><span class='diff-added'></span></div><span class='diff-added'></span><h2 id="Access_by_the_server-s_physical_IP_address"><span class='diff-added'>4. Access by the server's physical IP address</span></h2><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>Another "gotcha" that you may run into is http access using the actual IP itself.  Remember that the IP is not picked up by the site vhost and will not match a ServerName or ServerAlias - so it gets picked up by the default vhost.  This is just standard apache stuff, nothing Aegir or Drupal specific here, but quite the annoyance and a potential problem.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>You can easily work around it by simply adding the IP as a Site Alias in the site node in either the Aegir site (or another site that you may have defined which you would prefer the IP to address).</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>You can tell if you have the IP problem by simply pointing your browser to the sever by IP as </span><a href="http://999.999.999.999/" title="http://999.999.999.999/"><span class='diff-added'>http://999.999.999.999/</span></a><span class='diff-added'> and seing what comes up.  If you get an install screen, you have the problem.  You certainly do not want that install screen getting executed!</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>The good news is that fixing it is easy.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>Simply log into Aegir, click on Sites, click on the site name that you want the IP to address, click on Edit and scroll down to Domain Aliases.  Put the IP into the box, click on the Redirect checkbox so that Aegir instructs Apache to do a rewrite to the real domain name, and finally click Save.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>If you do not have the Domain Aliases entry box, you need to turn that feature on.  In that case, go to your administration menu at the top of the page, point to Hosting and then click on Features.  Click the checkbox for Site Aliasing and then Save Configuration.  The Aliases box will now appear when you edit a site.  There is excellent information about the site alias feature in this handbook at </span><a href="../../../../60/index.html" title="http://community.aegirproject.org/node/60"><span class='diff-added'>http://community.aegirproject.org/node/60</span></a><span class='diff-added'> with much more detail.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>After the Verify job completes you should test your server again.  Now when you address the server by it's IP address the URL should automatically change to the site you selected and the install screen never appears.</span></p><span class='diff-added'></span><div class="toc-back-to-top"><span class='diff-added'></span><a href="#toc"><span class='diff-added'>Back to top</span></a><span class='diff-added'></span></div><span class='diff-added'></span><script type="text/javascript"><span class='diff-added'>toc_scroll_back_to_top = 1;</span></script></div>    </div>
