<p>We have again found critical issues in rc3, detailed below, and a few key features that we wanted to slip into 1.0 that were just low-hanging fruits that deserved to be released. We hope this release candidate will be all shiny and without any critical issues so we can release it as 1.0.</p>

<h2>Key changes in 1.0-rc4</h2>

<ul>
<li>There is now a <code>~/clients</code> directory in which symlink are automatically created to allow easy access to all your client sites (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/1115960">#1115960</a>)</li>
<li>A variable is now set in <code>settings.php</code> (<code>aegir_api</code>) to allow contrib modules to inspect what Aegir version they are dealing with, if any. The setting is removed on export, that is, if dbcloaking is off (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/1027358">#1027358</a></li>
<li>We fixed a big regression where the mass migrate form stopped working in rc3 (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/1111532">#1111532</a>)</li>
<li>The <code>private</code> directory of Drupal 7 is now properly protected (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/1108810">#1108810</a>)</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../../../installing/debian/index.html">Debian package</a> has been tested over and over again and is now the prefered install method for people on Debian</li>
<li>Consequently, <code>install.sh</code> has been removed and the <a href="../../../../../installing/manual/index.html">manual install instructions</a> have been revamped to be clearer, see <a href="../../../../542/index.html">this post</a> for more information about the reasoning behind that change</li>
</ul><span class='diff-added'>

</span><h2><span class='diff-added'>Installing and upgrading</span></h2><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>The canonical source of installation documentation has moved from the usual INSTALL.txt to the community site at:</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><pre><span class='diff-added'></span><code><span class='diff-added'>http://community.aegirproject.org/installing
</span></code><span class='diff-added'></span></pre><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>In a similar fashion, the upgrade documentation has now been moved to the community site at</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><pre><span class='diff-added'></span><code><span class='diff-added'>http://community.aegirproject.org/upgrading
</span></code><span class='diff-added'></span></pre><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>Within those sections you'll find step-by-step instructions for performing both manual and automatic upgrade processes. You can download the upgrade.sh.txt script from </span><a href="../../../../431/index.html" title="http://community.aegirproject.org/node/431"><span class='diff-added'>http://community.aegirproject.org/node/431</span></a><span class='diff-added'>.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>It is still imperative that you read the the Upgrade Guide (</span><a href="../../../../../upgrading/index.html" title="http://community.aegirproject.org/upgrading"><span class='diff-added'>http://community.aegirproject.org/upgrading</span></a><span class='diff-added'>) and follow all version-specific upgrade instructions located at the end of the document before trying to run the upgrade script. This especially applies to users upgrading from before 0.4-alpha8, including 0.3.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>For users coming from the 0.4 betas or rc1/2, there are unlikely to be any version-specific manual steps required to upgrade to 1.0-rc4, but you should make a habit of reading them anyway just to make sure. No-one likes a nasty surprise!</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>The upgrade.sh script attempts to backup the existing backend components, download new versions, and then run the hostmaster-migrate command. It assumes you are upgrading from the previous release (hostmaster-6.x-1.0-rc3). If you are not, you may have to edit the script to change the OLD_DRUPAL_DIR variable.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><h2><span class='diff-added'>Need help?</span></h2><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>If you struggle to install or upgrade your Aegir system, you have a number of options available to you for getting help.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>Consult this page for more information: </span><a href="../../../../../help/index.html" title="http://community.aegirproject.org/help"><span class='diff-added'>http://community.aegirproject.org/help</span></a><span class='diff-added'></span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>Thanks to our awesome community for their help, support and encouragement as always! Enjoy the new release :)</span></p>

<h2>New features</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://drupal.org/node/1115960">#1115960: Moving a site between platforms causes confusion</a></li>
<li><a href="http://drupal.org/node/1027358">#1027358: Set a variable in settings.php so that modules can check whether the site is in Aegir</a></li>
<li><a href="http://drupal.org/node/1111932">#1111932: Move the suggestion of a client title into it's own function (for use when creating clients programatically)</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Bug fixes</h2>
