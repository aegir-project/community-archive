      <p>As of 1.0-rc4, install.sh.txt has been removed from provision, and it seems like this could use a little more explanations than <a href="http://drupalcode.org/project/provision.git/commit/51117a7386461748d50fa582e43c613b0223e14c">a terse commitlog</a>. The main reason behind this was that it was yet another script to maintain, and that script was doing almost nothing. Really.</p>

<p>All install.sh was doing was this:</p>

<ul>
<li>download and install drush</li>
<li>download and install provision (drush dl provision)</li>
<li>install the frontend (drush hostmaster-install)</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="../../installing/manual/index.html">manual install instructions</a> have been updated to explain how to install drush and provision and launch hostmaster-install. That process is <em>much</em> more flexible (as it easily allows rerunning parts of the install that fail) and intuitive (you understand how the darn thing works).</p>

<p>Besides, if you were able to configure <strong>all</strong> the requirements, you should be able to install drush by yourself. My experience in providing "Aegir install 101" trainings is that by the time people got to the "install.sh" step, they already figured out if they knew how to use a shell, knew what where commandline was or what "wget" was for. So install.sh didn't give us much. On the other hand, install.sh was making the install process much more opaque, scary and harder to understand for newcomers, so I am happy to finally having got rid of it.</p>

<p>Now, if Drush is too hard to install, you can use the <a href="http://packages.debian.org/drush">Drush Debian package</a> (that is also <a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/drush">in Ubuntu</a> or you should lobby the <a href="http://drush.ws/">Drush project itself</a> to make the <a href="http://drupalcode.org/project/drush.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/README.txt">install instructions</a> easier to read.</p>    </div>
