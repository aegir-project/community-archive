07:00 &lt;@mig5> scrum time
07:00 &lt;@anarcat> hi
07:00 &lt;@mig5> morning
07:01 &lt;@anarcat> good morning!
07:01 &lt;@anarcat> not much to report on my side again, other than i forgot to book a session for drupalcon :/
07:01 &lt;@mig5> hehe
07:01 &lt;@anarcat> we're working on LDAP support and we'll focus on intersite security after christmas
07:01 &lt;@mig5> i did make a tweet after i saw there are three aegir related proposals
07:01 &lt;@mig5> oh sweet! LDAP++
07:01 &lt;@anarcat> add a way for aegir to run tasks as a real user instead of itself, so that site A can't see site B's stuff
07:03 &lt;@mig5> cool - that's it from you?
07:04 &lt;@anarcat> yes, sorry
07:04 &lt;@mig5> no worries
07:04 &lt;@mig5> ok, so (again) i haven't done much
07:05 &lt;@mig5> i tried to address some of the for review tickets in the queue, committing two of hadsie's work which i tested
07:05 &lt;@anarcat> that's much :)
07:05 &lt;@mig5> i didn't get to test your debian packages against another squeeze install but i did comment on the ticket about what i think the issue is there
07:05 &lt;@anarcat> yeah, you're right about the issues, feel free to fix if you have time
07:06 &lt;@mig5> but mainly i have been just staring at the queue and feeling out of steam (again), I wonder whether it is time to look at adding more people to the 
              project
07:06 &lt;@anarcat> i agree
07:06 &lt;@mig5> as i feel i'm getting less and less useful, and vertice is taking a break etc,
07:06 &lt;@mig5> and you are tied up a lot with internal stuff (which is fine)
07:06 &lt;@anarcat> i don't feel you're less and less useful though :P
07:07 &lt;@mig5> well that's ok :) i think it speaks for itself
07:07 &lt;@mig5> and things have slowed down so lets get some more hands on deck basically.
07:07 &lt;@mig5> also, i have a client at the moment who is interested in seeing two things happen:
07:07 &lt;@mig5> a dns frontend and scheduled tasks
07:07 &lt;@mig5> Steven Jones has been doing great work with scheduled tasks and created a contrib project hosting_backup_queue
07:08 &lt;@mig5> i was going to ask whether Koumbit were already working on a dns frontend
07:08 &lt;@mig5> we can discuss that later if you like
07:08 &lt;@mig5> and that's about it from me
07:09 &lt;@anarcat> ok, anybody else?
07:09 &lt;@mig5> maybe it would be nice to summarise these scrum sessions as a 'weekly aegir news' email to the mailing list, making people aware of stuff like Steven 
              Jones' contrib project etc
07:09 &lt;@anarcat> mig5: i have ideas on the frontend: 1) there should be code we can resurrect from older git repos and 2) i have a workflow for the blacklisting 
                 algorithm (can't let anyone host any zone can't we...)
07:09 &lt;@anarcat> yep
07:10 &lt;@mig5> i am happy to do so
07:11 &lt;@mig5> (re: news)
07:11 &lt;@mig5> ok -we are 11 minutes in anyone else have anything to add?
07:12 &lt; erutan> re: news to save time you could always just dump the relevant irc log onto the open atrium site
07:12 &lt;@mig5> we do that already, yep
07:12 &lt;@mig5> maybe that's enough.
07:12 &lt;@anarcat> yeah...
07:13 &lt;@anarcat> alright, thanks for coming everyone!
07:13 &lt;@mig5> cheers
