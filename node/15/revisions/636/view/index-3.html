</ul></div><p>Aegir undergoes rigorous testing, but no actively-developed software ever escapes bugs.</p>

<p>If you feel you have encountered a bug, the <a href="../../../../14/index.html">FAQ</a> is the first place to check if there's a simple solution.</p>

<h1>Common installation and configuration errors</h1>

<p>Aegir is a more complex product than your average Drupal site. Something that has far-reaching control over bits of your server and your sites results in more bits and pieces working together, and inevitably it becomes possible to misconfigure, break, or miss setting up any one of these components.</p>

<p>The installation and upgrade procedure has evolved from these pains to becoming something almost purely automated. Nonetheless, making a mistake during the installation of Aegir or Drush is still easy to do, and these tips identify the most common mistakes.</p>

<h2>If Something Goes Wrong</h2>

<p>If an installation fails partway, particularly while using the install.sh script, you may not be able to run it successfully until you've rolled back any changes that the script has made. Delete the contents of the /var/aegir directory (not the directory itself) making sure to remove any hidden directories like /var/aegir/.drush. Also, drop any new MySQL database (which will be named according to the hostmaster domain name).</p>

<h2>The Aegir User</h2>

<p>Make sure you have an aegir user (who we call the Aegir User) and that the Aegir User is properly configured on your server.</p>

<p>Typing 'id aegir' on your system should print something like this as output.</p>

<p><div class="codeblock"><code>aegir:~# id aegir<br />uid=104(aegir) gid=108(aegir) groups=108(aegir),33(www-data)</code></div></p>

<p>If you don't want to use a user called 'aegir' for the installation, that's possible (albeit not recommended). Be cautious about using a different username, and do not use an existing user or a user that will have any other role on the server. The Aegir User has certain privileges and should only be used for Aegir activities.</p>

<h2>Aegir User's home directory</h2>

<p>Verify the Aegir install directory is the user's home. In a standard installation, the Aegir directory is /var/aegir.</p>

<p>Be cautious about installing Aegir in a different directory - it is easy to get confused since nearly all the documentation tries to be consistent by assuming you have used /var/aegir and you'll otherwise constantly have to translate this mentally when trying to learn.</p>

<h2>Aegir User as script user</h2>

<p>Make sure that the 'Server' node in your Aegir system (this is usually the node located at /node/2) lists the 'Script User' as being your Aegir User. You can also find this node by clicking on the Servers menu tab and then clicking on the server URI shown in the list that appears of Aegir-managed servers. In a basic installation, there is only one server.</p>

<h2>Do not run as root</h2>

<p>Do not run aegir as root! It's an unsafe and unsupported configuration that is known to cause problems.</p>

<h2>Drush</h2>

<p>A standard Aegir installation will check that Drush is functioning properly, or if it doesn't find Drush at all, will install it for you.</p>

<p>Always run drush as your aegir user, and never as "root".</p>

<h2>Provision</h2>

<p>Make sure that the Provision module is in the aegir/.drush/provision/ directory. A standard Aegir installation will install this for you.</p>

<h2>MySQL</h2>

<p>Aegir uses the 'root' user of the MySQL server to create and manage databases. If MySQL is running on the same server, Aegir will still attempt to connect to the database as if remotely. If the MySQL server is security hardened to prevent this type of access, this would result in MySQL errors during Aegir installation.</p>

<p>To see the root users. Connect to MySQL database and run the query
<div class="codeblock"><code>SELECT user, host, password FROM mysql.user WHERE user = &#039;root&#039;;</code></div></p>

<p>There should be separate records for the host <code>localhost</code> and <code>hostname</code>, and the password hashes should be the same to avoid confusion. If the password hashes are different, which is possible if the root user password has been updated with mysqladmin, you can make the passwords consistent by running:</p>

<p><div class="codeblock"><code>UPDATE user SET Password=PASSWORD(&#039;new_password&#039;)&nbsp; WHERE host=&#039;hostname&#039; AND user=&#039;root&#039;;<br />FLUSH PRIVILEGES;</code></div></p>

<h2>Apache</h2>

<p>Make sure the Aegir User can restart Apache without a password and that the corresponding command is defined in your Aegir 'Server' node.</p>

<p>As your Aegir User, run the command shown in the "Restart command" field in your Aegir 'Server' node to ensure that your Aegir User can in fact restart Apache (if not, see the Sudo information below).</p>

<p>On Debian/Ubuntu, the command sudo /usr/sbin/apache2ctl graceful. The command should execute and return without asking for a password when run as the Aegir User.</p>

<p>Make sure Apache can parse its configuration without syntax errors. On Ubuntu, sudo apache2ctl configtest should report "Syntax OK".</p>

<h2>Sudo</h2>

<p>Check that the aegir user is in your /etc/sudoers file with the permission to restart Apache. Instructions and an example for doing this are contained in the INSTALL.txt.</p>

<p>On a Linux system, check that /etc/sudoers is chmod 440 (i.e., read only for the file owner and group, which is usually root)</p>

<h2>Attempt to run the task queue manually from the command line</h2>

<p><div class="codeblock"><code>php /var/aegir/drush/drush.php @hostmaster hosting-tasks --debug</code></div></p>

<h2>Run a specific task in the queue from the command line</h2>

<p><div class="codeblock"><code>php /var/aegir/drush/drush.php @hostmaster hosting-task &lt;nid of the task&gt; --debug</code></div></p>

<h2>Run the 'Cron' queue manually from the command line</h2>

<p><div class="codeblock"><code>php /var/aegir/drush/drush.php @hostmaster hosting-cron --debug</code></div></p>    </div>

</ul></div><p>Want to talk with the Aegir community? There are many channels with various virtues.</p>

<p><strong>Discussion Forum</strong></p>

<p>The community site has a <a href="../../../../../discussion/index.html">discussion area</a> that anyone can use to talk about Aegir with others or seek support.</p>

<p><strong>IRC</strong></p>

<p>You can <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#aegir">join the #aegir channel at Freenode</a> on IRC. There's a loyal community of Aegir developers and users that frequent this channel. Much development discussion also takes place here, and support questions are welcomed.</p>

<p>The core developers also are reachable in #aegir on IRC.</p>

<p>Remember that Aegir, like Drupal, transcends timezones, and even the developers are many hours apart from each other. Sometimes it's quiet, and sometimes it's very busy. Don't repeat yourself: someone will respond eventually if not immediately.</p>

<p>New to IRC? IRC instructions for Drupal users are at: <a href="http://drupal.org/irc" title="http://drupal.org/irc">http://drupal.org/irc</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Mailing Lists</strong></p>

<p>There are mailing lists that can be used for support, general discussion and development or announcements.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://listes.koumbit.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/announce-lists.aegirproject.org">announce</a> - the announce mailing list is used to announce new releases or major news</li>
<li><a href="https://listes.koumbit.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/users-lists.aegirproject.org">users</a> - the user mailing list is used for general discussions and support for Aegir users</li>
<li><a href="https://listes.koumbit.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/core-lists.aegirproject.org">core</a> - the core mailing list is used for internal discussions in the <a href="../../../../../maintainers/index.html">core team</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Events</strong></p>

<p>Aegir is often present at many of the popular DrupalCamps and DrupalCons, either as a formal session or in smaller BOF sessions.</p>

<p>We encourage users who are confident in using Aegir to demonstrate it at any relevant events they attend, and to <a href="../../../../7/index.html">post slides/screencasts</a> so that others can benefit.</p>

<p><strong>Blogs</strong></p>

<p>As well as the News/Blog area here, the developers also often blog about new Aegir features or share handy tips for the community. Here are two blogs to stay up to date with:</p>

</ul></div><p>Reporting bugs is a great way to contribute to Aegir and it helps all of us (developers and users both) shape Aegir into the fantastic Drupal management system we want and need.</p>

<h2>Before reporting bugs</h2>

<p>Mis-reporting bugs that are due to not following instructions or skipping steps, not providing enough information or duplicating reports, however, can be a distraction to the development team and waste precious resources. So, help out by following these guidelines for reporting bugs.</p>

<p>Before you report a bug, make sure you have done things right and are sure it's a bug, by reviewing the <a href="../../../../../help/index.html">Getting help</a> section, if only to include the right information 
in your bug report.</p>

<h2>Where to report bugs</h2>

<p>Somehow a bug or two may have slipped into Aegir. Eek! So it's really a bug? A <em>new</em> bug? To report it, file an issue on Drupal.org:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/hosting">Hosting</a> (if the issue is in the frontend)</li>
<li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/provision">Provision</a> (if the issue is in the backend) or</li>
<li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/hostmaster">Hostmaster</a> (if it is in the installer, a documentation bug, or if you don't know where the issue should go).</li>
<li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/eldir">Eldir</a> (if it's an issue with the default Eldir theme that ships with Aegir.)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Feature Requests</h2>

<p>Feature requests are, of course, always welcome in these queues as well. To get an idea of where Aegir is headed with new features, you should first consult the <a href="../../../../35/index.html">Aegir Roadmap</a> and <a href="../../../../34/index.html">Project Goals</a> - we may be already on it!</p>    </div>

<p>The small core team that works on Aegir does this mostly because they use it themselves. That however does not cover all the time we work on Aegir.<br />
Our passion to produce a good product, and love for Drupal, drives us to keep working on this, but there is a risk of developer burnout.<br />
For example: supporting older versions and making upgrade paths user-friendly is a lot of work. While the core team has only limited personal need for this.<br />

      <p>With the Aegir site working, and Hostmaster running, when I set up a drupal platform and a new site on the platform, and click the "Go to new site" button, I get "The requested URL / was not found on this server."  Also, I am not sure that I have the domain forwarding for the domain name set up right on Godaddy.  Can't get to the new site. Any suggestions or leads to documentation?</p>    </div>
