</span><p><span class='diff-added'>Nonetheless, the upgrade process can seem a little daunting to users. This is mainly because some expectation arises that because Aegir is built on Drupal, and is made for managing Drupal sites, it seems reasonable to expect the upgrade process to be as straightforward as, say, upgrading a regular Drupal site.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>Aegir is a powerful system that goes beyond a normal Drupal application by being split into two parts: a frontend (the browser-based control panel) and the backend (bits on the system in /var/aegir, such as Drush and Drush extensions), along with a system user on your server that runs command-line scripts and restarts services, and cronjobs.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>Typically what this means is that when it comes time to upgrade Aegir, you not only have to upgrade the frontend site, but also update the components that reside in the 'backend'.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>But don't panic! We have instructions and even a script to run, to take care of almost all of it for you, eliminating as much as possible the chance for human error.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>This guide is not the official upgrade instructions for your system. It merely explains the purpose of UPGRADE.txt and what it actually does. You </span><strong><span class='diff-added'>must</span></strong><span class='diff-added'> follow the UPGRADE.txt precisely in order to upgrade your system.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><h2><span class='diff-added'>UPGRADE.txt</span></h2><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>In a similar fashion to the </span><a href="../../../../9/index.html"><span class='diff-added'>Install instructions</span></a><span class='diff-added'>, the upgrade process for Aegir resides in an UPGRADE.txt that ships with each release inside the 'Provision' component.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>It is kept in each release so that it may be versioned, as some upgrade steps may and often do differ between releases.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>The UPGRADE.txt is stored in the 'docs' directory of the Provision component, which gets installed in /var/aegir/.drush/ on standard systems. However, the announcement for each release (published here and on the mailing lists) always contains a link to the UPGRADE.txt, so you'll probably find it's easier to fetch it from there.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>Each time a new release of Aegir is made, there may be some 'version-specific' notes contained towards the bottom of the file. The reason for this is that sometimes a change in Aegir requires a new change or modification of some other component of your server. This might include adding, removing or changing a line in MySQL's /etc/mysql/my.cnf, or changing the location of an 'Include' path in Apache to read configurations from a new location.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>Because these modifications typically require administrative privileges to perform, they can't be automated or run by the system 'aegir' user on your server. This is the reason these notes are included in the UPGRADE.txt.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>** It is extremely important that you read the version-specific notes before following any other instructions in the UPGRADE.txt.**</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>If you fail to apply any of the version-specific steps and proceed with the generic upgrade process, that process is likely to fail.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><h2><span class='diff-added'>Upgrade process</span></h2><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>The typical upgrade process outlined at the start of the UPGRADE.txt is as follows:</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><ul><span class='diff-added'>
</span><li><span class='diff-added'>Read and apply the version-specific notes</span></li><span class='diff-added'>
</span><li><span class='diff-added'>Read the conventions and tips</span></li><span class='diff-added'>
</span><li><span class='diff-added'>Run the upgrade.sh.txt script, or the next three steps:</span></li><span class='diff-added'>
</span><li><span class='diff-added'>Set the environment variables</span></li><span class='diff-added'>
</span><li><span class='diff-added'>Upgrade the backend</span></li><span class='diff-added'>
</span><li><span class='diff-added'>Upgrade the frontend</span></li><span class='diff-added'>
</span></ul><span class='diff-added'>

</span><h2><span class='diff-added'>upgrade.sh.txt</span></h2><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>An upgrade.sh.txt is mentioned in the UPGRADE.txt. This automates the last three steps listed above, including backing up old components first. The upgrade.sh.txt has to assume that you have read and completed the version-specific steps first before attempting to run it.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><h2><span class='diff-added'>Manually upgrading</span></h2><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>Alternatively if you don't wish to run the script, you may proceed to export the environment variables. These are just abstractions to avoid having to re-type the same URLs or version numbers of Aegir and other components, which would otherwise introduce extra potential for human error.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>After your environment  variables are exported, you must then proceed to upgrade the backend. The reason for upgrading the backend first before the frontend, is that the frontend upgrade process (explained further below) is instigated by the backend using Drush Make. Thus you need to be running the new backend first in order to successfully produce a new frontend.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>Upgrading the backend is as simple as replacing your copy of Drush, Provision, and if necessary, Drush Make, with the new versions if available. These manual steps are provided to you in the UPGRADE.txt; you can literally copy and paste the steps into your terminal and expect good results.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>Once your backend is upgraded, you can upgrade your frontend. Think of this as the backend fetching a new copy of Drupal core and the Hostmaster frontend application onto your server, and then moving the Aegir site's settings.php and other bits and pieces over to the new codebase.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>The procedure for upgrading the frontend is entering your old hostmaster directory, (say, /var/aegir/hostmaster-$old-version) and running 'drush hostmaster-migrate $youraegirdomain.com'.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>The precise steps for performing this, just like the earlier parts, are all provided by the UPGRADE.txt. You can copy and paste the commands provided and you should get good results if you followed all the earlier steps.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>Did we remind you to </span><strong><span class='diff-added'>read the version-specific notes</span></strong><span class='diff-added'> first? This is the most common pitfall for users trying to upgrade their system.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><h2><span class='diff-added'>New release of Drupal core?</span></h2><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>Just as you would use the Migrate task in Aegir to upgrade one of your sites to a new copy of Drupal core, you can follow the UPGRADE.txt to upgrade your actual Aegir frontend system to a new copy of Drupal core too. The upgrade process (including the script) will always fetch the latest available copy of Drupal core to place the frontend on.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>Currently you cannot upgrade the Aegir site itself from the frontend with a Migrate task as you do for your managed sites. This may change in the future, but has not been developed yet.</span></p></div>    </div>
