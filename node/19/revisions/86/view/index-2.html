      <div id='diff-inline-19'><div class='diff-inline-metadata clear-block'><div class='diff-inline-byline'>Updated by <a href="../../../../../users/mig5/index.html" class="username" title="View user profile.">mig5</a> on 10/28/2010 - 00:19</div><div class='diff-inline-legend clear-block'><label>Legend</label><span class='diff-added'>Added</span><span class='diff-changed'>Changed</span><span class='diff-deleted'>Deleted</span></div></div><p><span class='diff-added'>So you've installed Aegir, arrived at the home page of your installation and are waiting for the magic to begin. On this page we'll introduce you to </span>Aegir<span class='diff-added'> and how easy it</span> is<span class='diff-added'> to use.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><h1><span class='diff-added'>Get to know the interface</span></h1><span class='diff-added'>

</span><h2><span class='diff-added'>Home</span></h2><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>Once you've successfully completed an Aegir installation, you'll be presented with the homepage, titled 'Home'.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>In a standard installation there won't be any sites listed here yet, other than the main Aegir site itself, which gets imported into the system during the installation. This is normal - Aegir even recognises itself as a Drupal site on your server, and to a limited degree is capable of 'managing' itself. Skynet is here!</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><h2><span class='diff-added'>Admin menu</span></h2><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>At the very top of the screen you'll see the Admin menu, which you may recognise as a popular contrib module</span> installed<span class='diff-added'> on many other sites, perhaps even some of your own. This gives you access to all the normal Drupal administrative functionality, which is not normally required in everyday Aegir user, but it also does provide you access to the 'Hosting' administrative settings where you can enable features that ship with Aegir and make other configuration changes.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><h2><span class='diff-added'>The Eldir theme</span></h2><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>The Aegir project ships with a default theme called 'Eldir' which is the classic navy blue, simplistic functional interface consistent with the overall Aegir brand. Eldir has been specifically designed for Aegir</span> - <span class='diff-changed'>nonetheless it is a Drupal theme like any other.</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><h2><span class='diff-changed'>Blocks</span></h2><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>Eldir has a main content section and a right sidebar. In the sidebar, several blocks are enabled by default.</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'></span><strong><span class='diff-changed'>Queues</span></strong><span class='diff-changed'></span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>The first is 'Queues'. 
Queues are Aegir's method of creating 'tasks' and putting them into a pool for the backend system to execute.</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>Two types of Queue exist in Aegir, though only one is enabled by default. These are</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><ul><span class='diff-changed'>
</span><li><span class='diff-changed'></span><p><span class='diff-changed'>the 'Task' queue (sending tasks to the backend to be executed by the 'aegir' user from the command line, such as installing, deleting, enabling, migrating sites and platforms)</span></p><span class='diff-changed'></span></li><span class='diff-changed'>
</span><li><span class='diff-changed'></span><p><span class='diff-changed'>the 'Cron' queue, which, when the Cron feature is enabled, runs cron on your site in batches.</span></p><span class='diff-changed'></span></li><span class='diff-changed'>
</span></ul><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>The task queue that you'll see upon installation shows all the tasks that Aegir has recently run, or is about to run. It shows the last 5, but there is a link to see the full list of historical tasks.</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>After installation there will be as many as three tasks in the task queue:</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><ul><span class='diff-changed'>
</span><li><span class='diff-changed'>a Verify task for the main 'server' node, </span></li><span class='diff-changed'>
</span><li><span class='diff-changed'>the Import task of the main Aegir site itself, and </span></li><span class='diff-changed'>
</span><li><span class='diff-changed'>the Verify task of the main Aegir 'platform' that hosts the Aegir site.</span></li><span class='diff-changed'>
</span></ul><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>These tasks are kicked off during the actual Aegir installation.</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>A task is colored
  * a neutral blue-grey if currently queued but not running yet
  * white with a spinning wheel if currently in the process of being run
  * green if completed successfully
  * red if there was an error</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>It's worth checking the queues regularly to see that the Task or Cron queues are being run regularly. If not you may have a problem with the cron setup on your server - see the </span><a href="../../../../14/index.html"><span class='diff-changed'>FAQ</span></a><span class='diff-changed'></span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'></span><strong><span class='diff-changed'>Hosting Summary</span></strong><span class='diff-changed'></span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>Below Queues, you will see a 'Hosting summary' of the Platforms that Aegir is managing.</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'></span><strong><span class='diff-changed'>Navigation</span></strong><span class='diff-changed'></span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>Underneath the Summary is the standard Navigation block in Drupal.</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><h2><span class='diff-changed'>Content</span></h2><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>The main content body in the Aegir interface lists</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><ul><span class='diff-changed'>
</span><li><span class='diff-changed'>your sites when on the frontpage or viewing the 'Sites' tab</span></li><span class='diff-changed'>
</span><li><span class='diff-changed'>your platforms when viewing the 'Platforms' tab</span></li><span class='diff-changed'>
</span><li><span class='diff-changed'>your servers when viewing the 'Servers' tab </span></li><span class='diff-changed'>
</span></ul><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>The main content area also is where nodes are viewable or editable, such as viewing more information on a site, platform or server, or editing/creating new entities of these types.</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><h2><span class='diff-changed'>Modalframe</span></h2><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>When clicking on a task's 'Run' or 'View' buttons, a modalframe dialog is loaded in the browser. This is to provide a fluid, attactive experience for the user without requiring them to leave the current page or node to perform operations on a site. When the action is performed on the task, the modalframe will close and the user will be returned to the page they were on when they clicked that button.</span></p></div>    </div>
