<p><span class='diff-changed'>A Drupal site managed by Aegir is really mostly the same as any other Drupal site. However, there are a few very minor differences that might surprise or confuse</span> some<span class='diff-added'> users.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>None</span> of<span class='diff-added'> these things adversely affect</span> the<span class='diff-added'> running of your site - they are designed to actually make your life even easier.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><h2><span class='diff-added'>Multisite</span></h2><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>Aegir installs sites on a platform, which means it places the site directory in /var/aegir/(yourplatform)/sites/(yoursite.com). Many sites can all be installed alongside each other inside a platform's 'sites' directory. This is a standard, built-in Drupal feature known as 'multisite', and it is not</span> unique <span class='diff-changed'>to Aegir.</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><h2><span class='diff-changed'>Settings.php and cloaked credentials</span></h2><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>Within a multisite structure where multiple sites share the same 'Document Root' or codebase on the system, administrative users on sites that have PHP access, are capable</span> of <span class='diff-changed'>manipulating the server into exposing the database credentials of other sites</span> in <span class='diff-changed'>that codebase with reasonable ease. This is a pretty serious disclosure of sensitive information, although</span> it <span class='diff-changed'>is only possible if users have PHP execution privileges. Any multisite installation of Drupal (even without Aegir) has this issue.</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>Regardless, security is very important to Aegir, and that's why special precautions are enabled by default to avoid this issue.</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>Essentially, when Aegir installs</span> a<span class='diff-added'> site and creates the settings.php for that</span> site,<span class='diff-added'> it 'masks' or 'cloaks' the database credentials, replacing them instead with environment variables fetched</span> from<span class='diff-added'> the $_SERVER array in PHP.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>The credentials are instead set in the site's Apache 'vhost' configuration file, which is stored outside the 'Document Root' or platform codebase, and is therefore safe from prying eyes by administrative users.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>Apache/PHP is able to read the environment variables from the vhost and understand the settings.php's mask, allowing your site to work as normal.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>If this feature confuses you or is inconvenient, you have</span> a <span class='diff-changed'>few options available to you:</span></p>

<ul>
<li><span class='diff-changed'>Run Nginx (which doesn't cloak the credentials)</span></li><span class='diff-changed'>
</span><li><span class='diff-changed'>Set </span><code><span class='diff-changed'>$options[&#039;provision_db_cloaking&#039;] = FALSE;</span></code><span class='diff-changed'> in the site's drushrc.php and then re-Verify the site</span></li>
<li><span class='diff-added'>Stop worrying and enjoy </span>the <span class='diff-changed'>extra security Aegir provides you</span></li><span class='diff-changed'>
</span></ul><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>Also note that when you run the Backup task against a site, it actually uncloaks the</span> credentials<span class='diff-added'> of the settings.php that it saves</span> in<span class='diff-added'> a tarball with the rest of the site. The benefit of this is that you are able to take the backup tarball and deploy it on a non-Aegir server, using standard Drupal, and your</span> settings.php<span class='diff-added'> will be in 'normal' Drupal form</span> for <span class='diff-changed'>that environment. This also makes it easier to 'import' sites from previous-Aegir installations, into new Aegir installations if need be.</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><h2><span class='diff-changed'>'Files' rewrite rule</span></h2><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>Everyone knows about the inconvenience of having to place an </span><code><span class='diff-changed'>img src</span></code><span class='diff-changed'> in your node that looks like this:</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><pre>
<code><span class='diff-changed'>&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/www.example.com/files/mycutecat.jpg&quot;&gt;</span></code><span class='diff-changed'>
</span></pre><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>If you ever deploy this site under a new URL or for whatever reason this path changes, those images or links will become broken</span> on<span class='diff-added'> the site. That's because this information ends up stored in the database, and it can be a pain to fix up.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>When you Migrate or Clone a site with Aegir, some paths in the database are automatically updated where they are consistent enough to be able to be scripted by Aegir (such as those in the</span> files<span class='diff-added'> table).</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>However, Aegir can't fix up actual node body content, as that would be risky,</span> and <span class='diff-changed'>as a rule, Aegir doesn't like tampering that deeply into your data. Aegir exists to help you manage your data, but not manipulate it except where absolutely necessary.</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>Fortunately, what Aegir </span><em><span class='diff-changed'>can</span></em><span class='diff-changed'> offer is adding a '/files' redirect in the Apache vhost configurations. This pattern-matching rule allows you to enter this into your node instead:</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><pre>
<code><span class='diff-changed'>&lt;img </span><span class='diff-added'>src=&quot;/files/mycutecat.jpg&quot;&gt;</span></code><span class='diff-added'>
</span></pre><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p>and <span class='diff-changed'>you can expect that to actually point to the same place. When you clone this site or rename</span> it<span class='diff-added'> to a new URL, this path doesn't actually </span><em><span class='diff-added'>need</span></em><span class='diff-added'> to change, because the Rewrite rule will be modified to point to the new location, thus avoiding breakages.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>It's not perfect, and people are often frustrated with Aegir not 'just fixing' everything like this, despite the fact the above</span> is <span class='diff-changed'>more than what Drupal does for you out of the box!</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>Fortunately, it's expected that Drupal 7 will improve this sort of thing altogether and things will hopefully become easier.</span></p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><h2><span class='diff-changed'>The .htaccess</span></h2><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p><span class='diff-changed'>Using a .htaccess with an </span><code><span class='diff-changed'>Allow Override all</span></code><span class='diff-changed'> directive in Apache can be a major performance killer, because it requires Apache</span> to <span class='diff-changed'>stat each subdirectory</span> of<span class='diff-added'> the codebase looking for overrides in .htaccess.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>As</span> a<span class='diff-added'> result, Aegir disables the reading of the Drupal</span> .htaccess<span class='diff-added'> in the runtime environment.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>This does not mean that the .htaccess is not needed. Instead, when you run the Verify task against a Platform, the .htaccess is studied by Aegir and its contents are copied</span> into<span class='diff-added'> the platform-wide Apache vhost configuration, typically located in </span><code><span class='diff-added'>/var/aegir/config/server_master/apache/platform.d</span></code><span class='diff-added'></span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>Need to make a modification to the .htaccess? Simple: you can simply edit it in-place as you normally would, but you must re-Verify the platform in Aegir afterward, in order for those new or modified settings to be 'loaded in' to</span> the platform vhost<span class='diff-added'> file.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>The end result is improved performance for your sites, without losing any functionality, as you can still customise the .htaccess to your liking.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><h2><span class='diff-added'>Permissions</span></h2><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>Permissions in Aegir generally follow these rules:</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><ul><span class='diff-added'>
</span><li><span class='diff-added'>Everything is owned by aegir:aegir, and the 'other' bit is read-only in most cases</span></li>
<li><span class='diff-added'>Things that need to be written to (uploads) by </span>the <span class='diff-changed'>web server, have the 'group' bit of 'www-data' (or whatever the relevant user/group is on your system) with the group bit writable</span></li><span class='diff-changed'>
</span><li><span class='diff-changed'>Anything that is sensitive information, such as the data in the configuration files, are owned by aegir:aegir or aegir:www-data when the web server needs to read those files, with no read access by the 'other' bit.</span></li>
</ul><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>The use of the 'aegir' user on the system is vital for normal Aegir functionality, however it can be confusing to users who wish to edit files (say, theme development on a site, or downloading new modules) as a user other than Aegir.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>The methodology recommend in these situations is:</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><ul><span class='diff-added'>
</span><li><span class='diff-added'>Add a standard user to your server, say, 'john'</span></li><span class='diff-added'>
</span><li><span class='diff-added'>Add that 'john' user to the 'aegir' group: </span><code><span class='diff-added'>adduser john aegir</span></code><span class='diff-added'></span></li><span class='diff-added'>
</span><li><span class='diff-added'>By default, Aegir sets the 'modules', 'themes' and 'libraries' directories so they are aegir:aegir with the group bit writable. This means that any user on the system who is a member of the 'aegir' group, is then able to add, delete, or modify files within those directories.  </span></li><span class='diff-added'>
</span></ul><span class='diff-added'>

</span><h2><span class='diff-added'>The drushrc.php</span></h2><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>You may have noticed a file called 'drushrc.php' on your system, stored alongside the settings.php of a site (and another in the root-level directory of your platform or Drupal core codebase). What's this about?</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>The drushrc.php is a file that contains important metadata about your site or platform. The significant portion of the file contains metadata on all 'packages' (modules, themes, install profiles and libraries) in that part of the system, including their version numbers and whether they are actually enabled or not.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>This file is generated by Aegir whenever a platform is verified, and whenever a site is installed or verified.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>Paradoxically, settings from the existing drushrc.php are able to be 'read in' by Aegir when performing those tasks and many others.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>The drushrc.php generally should not be edited unless you know what you're doing. As previously discussed above, some supported configurations such as the disabling of the 'cloaking' of database credentials in a site's settings.php, are able to be set in the drushrc.php to provoke the system into modifying how that site is to be treated.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>@TODO: Drush aliases</span></p></div>    </div>
