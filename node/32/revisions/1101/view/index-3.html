<h2>The release cycle</h2>

<p>In general, each major Hostmaster release comprises<span class='diff-deleted'> </span><span class='diff-deleted'>of</span> a simultaneous release of all the modules<span class='diff-added'> that are</span> part of the project. We generally go through <span class='diff-changed'>several testing</span> releases<span class='diff-added'> (alphas, betas &amp; RCs)</span> before doing the first <span class='diff-changed'>stable release for that branch.</span></p>

<ul>
<li>First an alpha is released to test new functionalities and to proceed accomplishing the goals decided in the <a href="../../../../35/index.html">Project Roadmap</a> for that major version. Example: <code>0.4-alpha1</code>, <a href="../../../../../0/index-4.html"><code>0.4-alpha15</code></a></li>
<li>When we have covered most of the functionalities outlined in the <a href="../../../../../roadmap/index.html">roadmap</a>, we bump that to a beta. We push out beta releases until no more critical issues show up. Example: <a href="../../../../../0/index-3.html"><code>0.4-beta1</code></a></li>
<li>Then we go into feature freeze and release a first release candidate (RC). Then a stable release branch is created, we enter a feature freeze on that branch and <code>master</code> is kept opened for development for the next stable release. Example: <a href="../../../../../0/index.html"><code>0.4-rc1</code></a>, <a href="../../../../360/index.html">freeze announcement</a></li>
<li>If no critical <span class='diff-changed'>bugs are</span> found, a complete release is <span class='diff-changed'>done. Otherwise</span> critical bugs are fixed and a new RC is done. That cycle repeats until no critical bugs are found, and a stable release is officially published.</li>
<li>Once a stable release is out, hotfixes are committed to the stable branch, and a stable release is published (without alpha/beta/RC) directly on the stable branch.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Making a release</h2>

<p>Each time we make a new release, we run a script called <code>release.sh</code> in provision.</p>

<p>This script should only be used by the core dev team when doing an official release. If you are not one of those people, you probably shouldn't be running this.</p>

<p>This script does all the 'hard' work in that it doesn't forget all the very many places to edit version numbers etc of relevant documentation and other scripts. This includes<span class='diff-deleted'> </span><span class='diff-deleted'>INSTALL.txt,</span><span class='diff-deleted'> </span><span class='diff-deleted'>UPGRADE.txt,</span> install.sh.txt and upgrade.sh.txt.</p>

<p>Paraphrasing from the script itself:</p>

<p><div class="codeblock"><code>The following operations will be done:<br /> 1. change the makefile to download tarball<br /> 2.<span class='diff-deleted'> </span><span class='diff-deleted'>change</span><span class='diff-deleted'> </span><span class='diff-deleted'>the</span><span class='diff-deleted'> </span><span class='diff-deleted'>INSTALL.txt</span><span class='diff-deleted'> </span><span class='diff-deleted'>to</span><span class='diff-deleted'> </span><span class='diff-deleted'>point</span><span class='diff-deleted'> </span><span class='diff-deleted'>to</span><span class='diff-deleted'> </span><span class='diff-deleted'>tagged</span><span class='diff-deleted'> </span><span class='diff-deleted'>install.sh</span><br /><span class='diff-deleted'></span><span class='diff-deleted'> </span><span class='diff-deleted'>3.</span><span class='diff-deleted'> </span><span class='diff-deleted'>change</span><span class='diff-deleted'> </span><span class='diff-deleted'>the</span><span class='diff-deleted'> </span><span class='diff-deleted'>UPGRADE.txt</span><span class='diff-deleted'> </span><span class='diff-deleted'>to</span><span class='diff-deleted'> </span><span class='diff-deleted'>point</span><span class='diff-deleted'> </span><span class='diff-deleted'>to</span><span class='diff-deleted'> </span><span class='diff-deleted'>release</span><span class='diff-deleted'> </span><span class='diff-deleted'>tags</span><br /><span class='diff-deleted'></span><span class='diff-deleted'> </span><span class='diff-deleted'>4.</span> change the install.sh.txt version<br /> <span class='diff-changed'>3.</span> change the upgrade.sh.txt version<br /> <span class='diff-changed'>4.</span> display the resulting diff<br /> <span class='diff-changed'>5.</span> commit those changes to git<br /> <span class='diff-changed'>6.</span> lay down the tag (prompting you for a changelog)<br /> <span class='diff-changed'>7.</span> revert the commit<br /> <span class='diff-changed'>8.</span> (optionally) push those changes<br /><br />The operation can be aborted before step <span class='diff-changed'>4</span> and <span class='diff-changed'>7.</span> Don&#039;t forget that as long as changes are not pushed upstream, this can all be reverted (see git-reset(1) and git-revert(1) ).</code></div></p>

<p>So in short, this sums up as:</p>

<p><div class="codeblock"><code>cd provision<br />sh release.sh 0.4-beta1 0.4-alpha15<br />cd ../hostmaster<br />git tag -a hostmaster-0.4-beta1<br />git push --tags</code></div></p>

<h2>Generating the release notes</h2>

<p>We build complete release notes for every release. Those are made up of a summary of the release, an outline of key changes, of known issues, install and upgrade instructions and a full list of bugfixes and new features.</p>

<p>We have a handy bookmarklet that takes the list of issues and build a release-notes-ready list:</p>

<p><div class="codeblock"><code>javascript:(function(){x%20=%20open().document;$(&quot;.views-field-title a&quot;).each(%20function()%20{%20x.write(&#039;* [&#039; + $(this).attr(&#039;href&#039;).replace(/\/node\//, &#039;#&#039;) + &#039;: &#039; + $(this).text()+&#039;](http://drupal.org&#039;+$(this).attr(&#039;href&#039;)+ &#039;)&lt;br%20/&gt;&#039;)%20})})()</code></div></p>

<p>The developers then proceed to format/edit the list of fixes as well as list other significant information/changes for this release. These notes end up becoming the Release Notes for the release.</p>

<h2>Creating release nodes on Drupal.org</h2>

<p>Once the tags are pushed and release notes published, we create a release node with an excerpt of (and a link to) the release notes so that tarballs are created and issue queue versions updated.</p>

<p>This needs to be done in the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/hostmaster">hostmaster</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/project/provision">provision</a> projects on Drupal.org.</p>

<h2>Publish the release notes widely</h2>

<p>Once all this is done and the tarballs are generated, the release notes are published in:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="../../../../66/index.html">handbook</a> (this is where the release notes live!)</li>
<li>A link to the release notes on the <a href="../../../../../index.html">frontpage of this site</a></li>
<li>An <a href="../../../../add/event/index.html">event in the calendar</a></li>
<li>The topic of the IRC channel</li>
<li>The aegir-announce mailing list</li>
<li>Twitter as @aegirproject</li>
</ul>

<p>Optionally, blog posts on developmentseed.org and elsewhere may go into further detail about significant changes, screencasts etc.</p></div>    </div>
