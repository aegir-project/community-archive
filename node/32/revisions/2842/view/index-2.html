<h1 id="The_release_cycle">1. The release cycle</h1>

<p>In general, each major Aegir release comprises a simultaneous release of all the modules that are part of the project. We generally go through several testing releases (alphas, betas &amp; RCs) before doing the first stable release on a branch.</p>

<ul>
<li>First an alpha is released to test new functionalities and to proceed accomplishing the goals decided in the <a href="../../../../35/index.html">Project Roadmap</a> for that major version. Example: <code>0.4-alpha1</code>, <a href="../../../../../0/index-4.html"><code>0.4-alpha15</code></a></li>
<li>When we have covered most of the functionalities outlined in the <a href="../../../../../roadmap/index.html">roadmap</a>, we bump that to a beta. We push out beta releases until no more critical issues show up. Example: <a href="../../../../../0/index-3.html"><code>0.4-beta1</code></a></li>
<li>Then we go into feature freeze and release a first release candidate (RC). Then a stable release branch is created, we enter a feature freeze on that branch and <code>master</code> is kept opened for development for the next stable release. Example: <a href="../../../../../0/index.html"><code>0.4-rc1</code></a>, <a href="../../../../360/index.html">freeze announcement</a></li>
<li>If no critical bugs are found, a complete release is done. Otherwise critical bugs are fixed and a new RC is done. That cycle repeats until no critical bugs are found, and a stable release is officially published.</li>
<li>Once a stable release is out, hotfixes are committed to the stable branch, and a stable release is published (without alpha/beta/RC) directly on the stable branch.</li>
</ul>

<p>See also <a href="../../../../../content/branch-and-tagging-conventions/index.html">the tag and branch naming convention</a>.</p>

<div class="toc-back-to-top"><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></div><h1 id="Steps_for_a_release">2. Steps for a release</h1>

<p>For the specifics of release naming conventions and the cycle, see <a href="../../../../187/index.html">the branch naming convention</a>.</p>

<div class="toc-back-to-top"><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></div><h2 id="Make_sure_Jenkins_is_all_green">2.1. Make sure Jenkins is all green</h2>

<p>Look into <a href="http://ci.aegirproject.org/">Jenkins</a> to see if all tasks have been performed without errors since the last commit. If there is an error, fix it before the release.</p>

<div class="toc-back-to-top"><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></div><h2 id="Generating_the_release_notes">2.2. <span class='diff-changed'>Generating</span> the <span class='diff-changed'>release notes</span></h2>

<p><span class='diff-changed'>We build complete release notes for every release. Those are made up of</span> a <span class='diff-changed'>summary of the</span> release, <span class='diff-changed'>an outline of key changes, of known issues, install and upgrade instructions and</span> a <span class='diff-changed'>full list </span><span class='diff-added'>of bugfixes and new features.</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>We have a handy bookmarklet that takes the list of issues and build a release-notes-ready list:</span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'></span><div class="codeblock"><code><span class='diff-changed'>javascript:(function(){x%20=%20open().document;$(&quot;.views-field-title a&quot;).each(%20function()%20{%20x.write(&#039;* [&#039; + $(this).attr(&#039;href&#039;).replace(/\/node\//, &#039;#&#039;) + &#039;: &#039; + $(this).text()+&#039;](http://drupal.org&#039;+$(this).attr(&#039;href&#039;)+ &#039;)&lt;br%20/&gt;&#039;)%20})})()</span></code></div><span class='diff-added'></span></p><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>The </span><span class='diff-changed'>developers then proceed to format/edit the list of fixes as well as list other significant information/changes for</span> this<span class='diff-added'> release. These notes end up becoming the Release Notes</span> for <span class='diff-changed'>the release, which are also entered in the </span><code><span class='diff-changed'>debian/changelog</span></code><span class='diff-changed'> file by the script below.</span></p>

<div class="toc-back-to-top"><a href="#toc"><span class='diff-changed'>Back to top</span></a></div><span class='diff-added'></span><h2 id="Running_the_release.sh_script"><span class='diff-added'>2.3. Running the release.sh script</span></h2><span class='diff-added'>

</span><p><span class='diff-added'>Each time we make a new release, we run a script called </span><code><span class='diff-added'>release.sh</span></code><span class='diff-added'> in provision.</span></p>

<p>This script should only be used by the core dev team when doing an official release. If you are not one of those people, you probably shouldn't be running this.</p>

<p>This script does all the 'hard' work in that it doesn't forget all the very many places to edit version numbers etc of relevant documentation and other scripts. This includes install.sh.txt and upgrade.sh.txt.</p>

<p>Paraphrasing from the script itself:</p>

<p><div class="codeblock"><code>The following operations will be done:<br /><span class='diff-added'> 0. prompt you for a debian/changelog entry</span><br /> 1. change the makefile to download tarball<br /> 2. change the upgrade.sh.txt version<br /> 3. display the resulting diff<br /> 4. commit those changes to git<br /> 5. lay down the tag<span class='diff-deleted'> </span><span class='diff-deleted'>(prompting</span><span class='diff-deleted'> </span><span class='diff-deleted'>you</span><span class='diff-deleted'> </span><span class='diff-deleted'>for</span><span class='diff-deleted'> </span><span class='diff-deleted'>a</span><span class='diff-deleted'> </span><span class='diff-deleted'>changelog)</span><br /> 6. revert the commit<br /> 7. (optionally) push those changes<br /><br />The operation can be aborted before step<span class='diff-deleted'> </span><span class='diff-deleted'>4</span><span class='diff-deleted'> </span><span class='diff-deleted'>and</span> 7. Don&#039;t forget that as<br />long as changes are not pushed upstream, this can all be reverted (see<br />git-reset(1) and git-revert(1) ).</code></div></p>

<p>So in short, this sums up as:</p>

<p><div class="codeblock"><code>cd provision<br />sh release.sh 6.x-1.2<br />cd ../hostmaster<br />git tag 6.x-1.2<br />git push --tags</code></div></p>

<div class="toc-back-to-top"><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></div><h2 id="Test_the_manual_install_in_Jenkins"><span class='diff-changed'>2.4.</span> Test the manual install in Jenkins</h2>

<p>Before making a full release, test the release in Jenkins. To do so, create a new build based on the 6.x-1.4 install build. Change the name of your new job to match the release version, and change the default value of the <code>AEGIR_VERSION</code> and <code>DRUSH_VERSION</code> to match what is required for this release.</p>

<p>Start a new build using 'git' as the <code>AEGIR_FETCH_MODE</code>.</p>

<p>If the build fails, delete the remote tags, fix the bugs and start again.</p><span class='diff-deleted'>

<div class="toc-back-to-top"><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></div><h2 id="Creating_release_nodes_on_Drupal.org">2.5. Creating release nodes on Drupal.org</h2>

<p>Once the tags are pushed and release notes published, we create a release node with an excerpt of (and a link to) the release notes so that tarballs are created and issue queue versions updated.</p>

<p>This needs to be done in the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/hostmaster">hostmaster</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/project/provision">provision</a> projects on Drupal.org.</p>

<div class="toc-back-to-top"><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></div><h2 id="Build_the_release_in_Jenkins_again">2.6. Build the release in Jenkins again</h2>

<p>At this point, it's possible that the tarballs on Drupal.org were not created properly. We want to test the real procedure, so run a your build again, but choose 'package' as the <code>AEGIR_FETCH_MODE</code>.</p>

<div class="toc-back-to-top"><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></div><h2 id="Build_the_Debian_packages">2.7. Build the Debian packages</h2>

<p>Build the package and upload to <a href="http://debian.aegirproject.org/" title="http://debian.aegirproject.org/">http://debian.aegirproject.org/</a>, as explained in those <a href="../../../../543/index.html">detailed instructions</a>.</p><span class='diff-changed'>

</span><p>Jenkins <span class='diff-changed'>should automatically build a Debian package when new code is committed </span><span class='diff-deleted'>one:</span></p><span class='diff-deleted'>

<div class="toc-back-to-top"><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></div><h2 id="Test_the_upgrade_in_Jenkins">2.8. Test the upgrade in Jenkins</h2>

<p>Once both of those taska have executed successfully, you can test the upgrade of the Debian packages by running the following Jenkins job:</p>

<p><a href="http://ci.aegirproject.org/view/Upgrades/job/U aegir 6.x-1.x deb upgrade/" title="http://ci.aegirproject.org/view/Upgrades/job/U%20aegir%206.x-1.x%20deb%20upgrade/">http://ci.aegirproject.org/view/Upgrades/job/U%20aegir%206.x-1.x%20deb%2...</a></p>

<div class="toc-back-to-top"><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></div><h2 id="Publish_the_Debian_packages">2.9. Publish the Debian packages</h2>

<p>Finally, when the Debian packages are tested you will need to pull them into the stable release channel:</p>

<p><a href="http://ci.aegirproject.org/view/Release scripts/job/R repo pull/" title="http://ci.aegirproject.org/view/Release%20scripts/job/R%20repo%20pull/">http://ci.aegirproject.org/view/Release%20scripts/job/R%20repo%20pull/</a></p>

<p>And then clear the unstable channel of the dev releases:</p>

<p><a href="http://ci.aegirproject.org/view/Release scripts/job/R clear unstable channel/" title="http://ci.aegirproject.org/view/Release%20scripts/job/R%20clear%20unstable%20channel/">http://ci.aegirproject.org/view/Release%20scripts/job/R%20clear%20unstab...</a></p>

<div class="toc-back-to-top"><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></div><h2 id="Publish_the_release_notes_widely">2.10. Publish the release notes widely</h2>

<p>Once all this is done and the tarballs are generated, the release notes are published in:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="../../../../66/index.html">handbook</a> (this is where the release notes live!)</li>
<li>A link to the release notes on the <a href="../../../../../index.html">frontpage block</a></li>
<li>An <a href="../../../../add/event/index.html">event in the calendar</a></li>
<li>A <a href="../../../../add/discussion/index.html">discussion post</a> (don't forget to make it 'sticky' &amp; remove stickiness from the previous announcement)</li>
<li>Update the version in the <a href="../../../../../upgrading/script/index.html">script upgrade page</a></li>
<li>The topic of the IRC channel</li>
<li>The aegir-announce mailing list</li>
<li>Twitter as @aegirproject</li>
</ul>
