</ul></div><p>The Aegir team is very pleased to announce the official release of Aegir 3.0. This release ships with significant stability improvements, Drush 6 and 7 support, improved SSL, subdirectory multisite and nginx support and much, much more!</p>

<p>This release marks the deprecation of the 2.x branch. We will continue to provide security releases through the end of 2015. All Aegir users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to the 3.0 release. The upgrade has been thoroughly tested and has worked reliably for us.</p>

<p>Upgrading from Aegir 2.x moves Aegir from a Drupal 6 platform to a Drupal 7 one. The Debian package will migrate the front-end for you. While we have tested this with Aegir core, we strongly recommend disabling any contributed modules you may be running.</p>

<p>We have a very dynamic community of contrib developers, and various projects built atop Aegir. So if you were waiting for Aegir 3 to be stable, easy to install and production-ready, now is the time. The 3.x branch will be well supported as a lot of shops are running it in production already.</p>

<h2 id="Major_changes">1. Major changes</h2>

<p>The front-end has been ported to Drupal 7. We've also raised the minimum Drush version to 6.x, and the Debian package now installs Drush via Composer. Drush 7 is also supported.</p>

<p>We've added several "Golden contrib" modules to the distribution:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hosting Remote Import</li>
<li>Hosting Site Backup Manager</li>
<li>Hosting Git</li>
<li>Hosting Tasks Extra</li>
</ul>

<p>We're planning to add additional well-supported contrib modules over the course of the Aegir 3.x lifecycle. Along similar lines, we've removed hosting_platform_pathauto, as it's built-in now.</p>

<p>We've introduced initial Drupal 8 support, though this is still a work-in-progress. This mostly depends on Drupal 8 and Drush 8 stabilizing, before we'll be able to more fully manage Drupal 8 sites.</p>

<p>Aegir 3 now supports SNI for SSL.</p>

<p>A number of significant bug fixes and stability improvements have been incorporated. Among them, we've added locking in our task queue, and improved backup reliability significantly.</p>

<p>For more information, please see the slidedeck from the presentation by ergonlogic and helmo at the Aegir Summit: <a href="../../../../../sites/community.aegirproject.org/files/aegir_core_and_contrib_-_nyc_summit_0/index.pdf" title="http://community.aegirproject.org/sites/community.aegirproject.org/files/aegir_core_and_contrib_-_nyc_summit_0.pdf">http://community.aegirproject.org/sites/community.aegirproject.org/files...</a></p>

<div class="toc-back-to-top"><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></div><h2 id="Major_API_changes">2. Major API changes</h2>

<p>The API has not significantly changed, though there are a few additions. See the current API docs in the various repositories for additional details.</p>

<div class="toc-back-to-top"><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></div><h2 id="Installing_and_upgrading">3. Installing and upgrading</h2>

<p>The canonical source of installation documentation is</p>

<p><a href="http://docs.aegirproject.org/en/latest/install/install/" title="http://docs.aegirproject.org/en/latest/install/install/">http://docs.aegirproject.org/en/latest/install/install/</a></p>

<p>We're in the process of converting our docs, the old version is on  <a href="../../../../../installing/index.html" title="http://community.aegirproject.org/installing">http://community.aegirproject.org/installing</a> We're tracking the conversion on <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2534734" title="https://www.drupal.org/node/2534734">https://www.drupal.org/node/2534734</a></p>

<p>In a similar fashion, the upgrade documentation is:</p>

<pre><code>http://community.aegirproject.org/upgrading
</code></pre>

<p>Within those sections you'll find step-by-step instructions for performing both <a href="../../../../../upgrading/manual/index.html">manual</a> and <a href="../../../../../upgrading/script/index.html">automatic</a> upgrade processes.</p>

<p>Note that you should upgrade to the latest 2.x release (currently: <a href="../../../../../2/index.html">2.4</a>) before attempting the upgrade to 3.x..</p>

<p>It is still imperative that you read the <a href="../../../../../upgrading/path/index.html">upgrade path and version-specific information</a> and follow all version-specific upgrade instructions before trying to run the upgrade script or manual upgrade.</p>

<div class="toc-back-to-top"><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></div><h2 id="Need_help">4. Need help?</h2>

<p>If you struggle to install or upgrade your Aegir system, you have a number of options available to you for getting help.</p>

<p>Consult this page for more information: <a href="../../../../../help/index.html" title="http://community.aegirproject.org/help">http://community.aegirproject.org/help</a></p>

<p>Thanks to our awesome <a href="../../../../../index.html">community</a> for their help, support and encouragement as always! Enjoy the new release :)</p>

<p>In addition to the "major changes" mentioned above, the following should also be noted.</p>

<p>Changes since 7.x-3.0-rc1:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="../../../../2494121/index.html">#2494121</a>: Stop servers in clusters from sync'ing back to master.</li>
  <li>Make the upgrade script slightly more verbose</li>
  <li><a href="../../../../2377819/index.html">#2377819</a>: Gzipping backups suppresses file permissions errors</li>
</ul>

<div class="toc-back-to-top"><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></div><h2 id="Known_issues">6. Known issues</h2>

<ul>
<li>Drupal 8 support is (Chasing HEAD) not complete. You would need Drush 8 for that.</li>
<li>Drush master has an issue on Debian Wheezy (<a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2491941" title="https://www.drupal.org/node/2491941">https://www.drupal.org/node/2491941</a>)</li>

      <p>The Aegir team is pleased to announce the first release candidate of the Aegir 3.x branch, after months of development. Development has been sometimes intermittent, but it is not over yet!</p>

<p>This release is tailored to make upcoming changes available to a wider audience than people ready to install from git, but also to make features more widely available and tested.</p>

<p>In the issue queues the central roadmap issue is: <a href="https://drupal.org/node/1261030">#1261030 [meta] Roadmap: Aegir 3.x (D7 port)</a></p>

<p>This maintenance release ships with a security fix for Apache installations.
Everyone is encouraged to upgrade. Re-verify is required for all sites (Views bulk operations makes this easy)</p>

<p>Also, worth noting is the simultaneous release of our <a href="../../../../../3/index-3.html">second beta for Aegir 3</a>. Debian packages are now being provided for Aegir 3, so trying it out is easier than ever!</p>

<p>In a similar fashion, the upgrade documentation is at:</p>

<p>Being really open about our project, we have never hidden the fact that some things, sometimes, do not work in Aegir. Our <a href="http://drupal.org/project/issues?text=&amp;projects=provision%2C%20hosting%2C%20hostslave%2C%20eldir%2C%20Hostmaster%20%28Aegir%29&amp;status=Open&amp;priorities=All&amp;categories=All">issue trackers</a> are public, and we've made it a point of honor not only to document clearly what is wrong in our releases as soon as we find out about it, but also to reroll new releases when we fix it.</p>

<p>That being said, 2.4 still has a number of issues and design flaws. This is the list of <a href="https://drupal.org/project/issues?projects=provision%2C+hosting%2C+hostslave%2C+eldir%2C+Hostmaster+%28Aegir%29&amp;priorities=300">all issues marked "major" in the queue right now</a>. Most issues are now likely to be fixed in the 3.x development branch, and unlikely to be backported unless considered critical.</p>

<p>As mentioned in the previous section, <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2146977">Issue #2146977: Broken backward compatibility with IP based vhosts</a> is still listed as a 'critical' issue against the 2.x branch. However, it should only affect those upgrading from 1.x, and has a fairly simple work-around. If you come across this behaviour during your upgrade, please post a comment to the issue, so we can confirm that it still exists.</p>

<p>The canonical source of installation documentation is on the community site at:</p>

<pre><code>http://community.aegirproject.org/installing
</code></pre>

<p>In a similar fashion, the upgrade documentation is:</p>

<pre><code>http://community.aegirproject.org/upgrading
</code></pre>

<p>Within those sections you'll find step-by-step instructions for performing both <a href="../../../../../upgrading/manual/index.html">manual</a> and <a href="../../../../../upgrading/script/index.html">automatic</a> upgrade processes.</p>

<p>It is still imperative that you read the the <a href="../../../../../upgrading/path/index.html">upgrade path and version-specific information</a> and follow all version-specific upgrade instructions before trying to run the upgrade script or manual upgrade. This especially applies to users upgrading from releases prior to 0.4-alpha8, including 0.3.</p>

<p>For users coming from the 0.4 betas or rc releases, there are unlikely to be any version-specific manual steps required to upgrade, but you should make a habit of reading them anyway just to make sure. No-one likes a nasty surprise!</p>

<p>This release is only a first of a series of alpha releases that are tailored to make upcoming changes available to a wider audience than people ready to install from git, but also to make features more widely available and tested.

<p>This release is tailored to make upcoming changes available to a wider audience than people ready to install from git, but also to make features more widely available and tested. More alpha releases will be published when there are substantial changes.</p>

<p>In the issue queues the central roadmap issue is: <a href="https://drupal.org/node/1261030">#1261030 [meta] Roadmap: Aegir 3.x (D7 port)</a></p>

</ul></div><p>The Aegir team is proud to announce the second release in the stable 2.x release branch!</p>

<p>But first, here's a word from Antoine Beaupré:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This latest release of the Aegir project will be the last one for me as a release manager, as I will be stepping down from the leadership position I have filled in the 7 years of involvement in this amazing project. I will continue to contribute to the project, to a lesser extent. I will remain available, through <a href="http://koumbit.org/">Koumbit</a>, to provide high-level consulting work for Aegir. We can also now welcome <a href="http://praxis.coop/">Praxis Labs Coop</a> as a new consulting partner of the Aegir project. Praxis will help to finance ongoing Aegir development by subsidizing part of my salary, in a similar fashion to how Omega8.cc had in the past.</p>
  
  <p>Working with the Aegir project was a huge challenge, both from a technical perspective, but also from a human standpoint, as it is a large and complex project that may seem daunting for new users. But with regular releases and continuous support in the issue queue, I think we have been able to foster a great community of contributors that goes beyond what a single person can do, as Adrian proved when he left the project with the <a href="../../../../../1/index-12.html">1.0 release</a> in 2011. Christopher (ergonlogic) and other contributors have shown they are in a good position to take over that leadership role, and will do so from now on.</p>
  
  <p>Now it is my turn to move on, and I am quite proud of what I leave behind. This project allowed me to travel around the world, meet incredible people and learn a lot about hosting and provisioning. It is however time for me to move on. I have been involved with the Drupal community for over 13 years, and things, to put it lightly, have changed. PHP is attempting to become a real programming language, something that I didn't believe could or should happen, and I wish to move on to other paradigms. Python and Haskell are waiting for me around this turn in the road, and even Perl and shell scripting look awesome in comparison to those <a href="http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/">dreaded PHP years</a>. Besides, since Aegir started, lots of configuration management systems have popped up that we can leverage to host way more than PHP and Drupal: Docker, Chef, Puppet hold lots of promise for those of us who dare to get out of the NIH syndrome. Hopefully, that energy will be reusable in the Aegir project as we head towards Aegir 4!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And so, thank you, Antoine, for all your great contributions as leader of the Aegir project! You have been an inspiration to many of us, and have provided superbly <a href="https://medium.com/tech-talk/b193a544e771">effective technical leadership</a>.</p>

<p>This release ships with support for Apache 2.4, along with updates to Drupal core and ModalframeAPI. A number of bug-fixes are included affecting deployment of Drupal 7 sites, aliases with sub-directory installs, backups, among other things. See below for the full lists of new features and bug fixes. Everyone is encouraged to upgrade.</p>

<p>The canonical source of installation documentation is on the community site at:</p>

<p>In a similar fashion, the upgrade documentation is at:</p>

<pre><code>http://community.aegirproject.org/upgrading

<p>Within those sections, you'll find step-by-step instructions for performing both <a href="../../../../../upgrading/manual/index.html">manual</a> and <a href="../../../../../upgrading/script/index.html">automatic</a> upgrade processes.</p>

<p>It is still imperative that you read the the <a href="../../../../../upgrading/path/index.html">upgrade path and version-specific information</a> and follow all version-specific upgrade instructions before trying to run the upgrade script or manual upgrade. This especially applies to users upgrading from releases prior to 0.4-alpha8, including 0.3.</p>

<p>For users coming from the 0.4 betas or rc releases, there are unlikely to be any version-specific manual steps required to upgrade, but you should make a habit of reading them anyway just to make sure. Noone likes a nasty surprise!</p>

<p>Being really open about our project, we have never hidden the fact that some things, sometimes, do not work in Aegir. Our <a href="http://drupal.org/project/issues?text=&amp;projects=provision%2C%20hosting%2C%20hostslave%2C%20eldir%2C%20Hostmaster%20%28Aegir%29&amp;status=Open&amp;priorities=All&amp;categories=All">issue trackers</a> are public, and we've made it a point of honor not only to document clearly what is wrong in our releases as soon as we find out about it, but also to reroll new releases when we fix it.</p>

<p>That being said, 2.1 still has a number of issues and design flaws. This is the list of <a href="https://drupal.org/project/issues?projects=provision%2C+hosting%2C+hostslave%2C+eldir%2C+Hostmaster+%28Aegir%29&amp;priorities=300">all issues marked "major" in the queue right now</a>. Most issues are now likely to be fixed in the 3.x development branch, and unlikely to be backported unless considered critical.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>hosting-queued</code> doesn't get properly re-enabled on upgrades, see <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2114675">#2114675</a> for a workaround.</li>

This long-awaited release ships with significant stability improvements, Drush 5 and 6 support, subdirectory multisite support, improved nginx support, native views and much, much more! We unfortunately had to drop support for Drupal 5, as Drush 5 and 6 dropped support for this unsupported Drupal release.</p>

<p>This release deprecates the 1.x branch, marking the 1.11 release as the last one of the 1.x branch. All Aegir users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to the 2.0 release. The upgrade has been thoroughly tested and works fairly reliably, except some documented minor issues.</p>

<p>We have a very dynamic community of contrib developers, and various projects built atop Aegir. So if you were waiting for Aegir 2 to be stable, easy to install, production-ready, now is the time. The 2.x branch will be well supported as a lot of shops are running it in production already.</p>

<h1 id="Major_changes_in_this_release">1. Major changes in this release</h1>

<p>Since th 1.0 stable release (<a href="../../../../../1/index-12.html">1.0</a>) in April 2011, we've done an incredible amount of work. The code size nearly doubled as did the development team and user base. We have accomplished a significant number of the <a href="../../../../../roadmap/2/index.html">release goals we set for 2.0</a>, but not all. Here is a broad breakdown of the most important improvements between the 1.11 and 2.0 releases:</p>

<ul>
<li>Subdirectory multisite support

<ul>
<li>you can now have different sites in example.com/foo and example.com/bar, a great feature if you do not control DNS, as well as for local development!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>SSL improvements

<ul>
<li>IP allocation improvement: addresses can be changed, added and removed more easily, and are managed from the front-end now.</li>
<li>SSL certificate generation now has saner defaults (e.g. 2048bits)</li>
<li>better error handling</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Drush 5 &amp; 6 support

<ul>
<li>includes better support for archive-dump command</li>
<li>means we also drop the dependency on drush make 2.3, now included in Drush 5</li>
<li>support for Drush 4 has been dropped, the minimum version is now 5.5, but Drush 6 or 5.10+ is recommended.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Packaging improvements and changes

<ul>
<li>Nginx support in the Debian package</li>
<li>now a "native" debian package</li>
<li>package name changed: it is now <code>aegir2</code>, <code>aegir2-provision</code>, etc, to avoid overwriting the previous package - note that aegir 1 and 2 can <em>not</em> be installed in parallel</li>
<li>hosting and eldir now split back in their own projects on dripal.org</li>
<li>using Drupal.org packaging tools to provide a full tarball for the whole frontend, speeding up installs significantly</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Nginx improvements:

<ul>
<li>fixed support for nginx 1.3 and newer</li>
<li>better defaults for caching</li>
<li>SSL and Nginx are now officially supported (not marked as "experimental")</li>
</ul></li>
<li>New modules:

<ul>
<li>the <code>hosting-queue-runner</code> module is now <a href="https://drupal.org/node/1189556">merged into core</a> as <code>hosting-queued</code></li>
<li>"pack" module, designed as a lightweight replacement to the "cluster" module, now available as an experimental extension</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hosting-queued improvements

<ul>
<li>run with a lower priority ("<em>niced</em>")</li>
<li>improved portability and reliability of startup script</li>
<li>enabled by default in the Debian package</li>
<li>improved stability</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Code refactoring and improvements:

<ul>
<li>now using the Symphony autoloading code</li>
<li>fix coding style in a lot of source files</li>
<li>improved builtin test suite</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Frontend improvements:

<ul>
<li>all custom displays ported to Views and VBO</li>
<li>nicer frontpage</li>
<li>new and improved roles with more useful default permission sets</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Documentation improvements:

<ul>
<li>Our documentation initiative to <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1111254">better document the Hostmaster API</a> has progressed nicely</li>
<li>we'll be launching an updated version of our <a href="http://api.aegirproject.org/">API site</a> (along the lines of api.drupal.org) shortly, to ease exploring the code-base of the Aegir Project, see <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1111254#comment-4287518">this issue</a>. </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>For a more detailed list of new functionalities, bugfixes and API changes, see below.</p>

<p>Some goals of the <a href="../../../../../roadmap/2/index.html">original 2.0 roadmap</a> have <em>not</em> been accomplished, namely:</p>

<ul>
<li>modular backup, platform and queuing systems - although work has started on Wordpress support, and an overhaul of the Aegir architecture is considered for 4.0, which will affect queuing systems (see below)</li>
<li>DNS, PostgreSQL and statistics efforts have mostly stalled</li>
<li>clone and migrate optimizations still have to be completed</li>
<li>completely automatic upgrades have not been implemented, although the Debian package upgrades are working generally well</li>
<li>the release was about 2 months late from the <a href="../../../../../discuss/another-stab-short-and-long-term-roadmap-aegir-2x-and-3x/index.html">october 31st estimate</a></li>
</ul>

<div class="toc-back-to-top"><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></div><h2 id="x_branch_maintenance_policy">1.1. 2.x branch maintenance policy</h2>

<p>With the 2.0 release, the Aegir project wished to adopt the growing standard of <a href="http://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a>. Unfortunately, the tools on Drupal.org <a href="https://drupal.org/node/1612910">do not allow 3-digits version numbers in contrib</a>, something of a blocker to allow us to use that great numbering scheme. So we will stick to our previous scheme for now, but we'll consider a switch to semver for 3.0.0.</p>

<p>No API change will be done in the 2.x branch. All core development will now happen on the 3.x branch, which shifts the focus of development to the port of the frontend to Drupal 7 (almost complete).</p>

<p>Note that the 2.x API has already been frozen for some time, since the first release candidate, to be more precise. Major changes to 2.x will not be committed unless they are first tested in 3.x and merged back. However, we wish the 2.x branch to be relatively short-lived, and it is more likely that major changes will <em>not</em> be backported from 3.x unless absolutely necessary for users needing a Drupal 6 Aegir frontend.</p>

<p>The 1.x branch is now deprecated and the 1.11 release will be the last release of that venerable branch, unless we need another release to fix the upgrade path to the 2.x branch. This is considered very unlikely. Security fixes or critical issues will therefore <em>not</em> be backported to the 1.x branch.</p>

<div class="toc-back-to-top"><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></div><h2 id="The_future">1.2. The future</h2>

<p>While we're very proud of what we've accomplished in Aegir 2.0, we've also been working in parallel to port Aegir to Drupal 7. Aegir 3.0 has already begun as a fairly straight-forward port. As such, we'll be releasing our first alpha of Aegir 3 shortly. We would like to have a stable Aegir 3.0 release before the release of Drupal 8, to allow for users to transition as Drupal 6 enters its end-of-life phase.</p>

<p>The reason for the change to semantic versioning is that we've been discussing a full re-write of Aegir for some time, and would like to do so with Aegir 4. The changes are likely to be fairly drastic, and so we want to be able to keep moving Aegir 3 forward in the mean time. By moving to Drupal 7, we expect to have bought ourselves 2+ years of breathing room within which to accomplish this re-architecture and the semantic versioning system allows us to integrate major changes in the 3.x branch progressively.</p>

<p>When the Aegir project started (back in 2008), the free software options for systems management software were very limited. As a result, we wrote our own code to do things like deploying code, writing configuration files, starting and stopping services, and so forth. Now, as 2014 begins, there are a wealth of tools that perform  these functions (e.g. Puppet and Chef, but also Openshift, Docker, etc), each with their own communities supporting them. We are exploring how we might be able to leverage these tools, rather than maintaining our own partial implementations, that will never likely be as robust as these more specialized projects.</p>

<p>We feel that the time is opportune since Drupal 8 will require significant re-writing of the front-end components. In addition, re-writing the backend so completely will allow us to seriously consider moving to a programming language other than PHP; one that would be better suited to the project's long-term goals, such as Python or Ruby.</p>

<div class="toc-back-to-top"><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></div><h1 id="Installing_and_upgrading">2. Installing and upgrading</h1>

<p>The canonical source of installation documentation is on the community site at:</p>

<pre><code>http://community.aegirproject.org/installing
</code></pre>

<p>In a similar fashion, the upgrade documentation is:</p>

<pre><code>http://community.aegirproject.org/upgrading
</code></pre>

<p>Within those sections you'll find step-by-step instructions for performing both <a href="../../../../../upgrading/manual/index.html">manual</a> and <a href="../../../../../upgrading/script/index.html">automatic</a> upgrade processes.</p>

<p>It is still imperative that you read the the <a href="../../../../../upgrading/path/index.html">upgrade path and version-specific information</a> and follow all version-specific upgrade instructions before trying to run the upgrade script or manual upgrade.</p>

<p>For users coming from the 2.0 betas or recent rc releases, there are unlikely to be any version-specific manual steps required to upgrade, but you should make a habit of reading them anyway just to make sure. No-one likes a nasty surprise!</p>

<p>Note that you should upgrade to the latest 1.x release (currently: <a href="../../../../../1/index-3.html">1.9</a>) before attempting the upgrade to 2.x. This is especially important if you are running a pre-1.0 release (poor you!).</p>

<div class="toc-back-to-top"><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></div><h2 id="Need_help">2.1. Need help?</h2>

<p>If you struggle to install or upgrade your Aegir system, you have a number of options available to you for getting help.</p>

<p>Consult this page for more information: <a href="../../../../../help/index.html" title="http://community.aegirproject.org/help">http://community.aegirproject.org/help</a></p>

<p>Thanks to our awesome <a href="../../../../../index.html">community</a> for their help, support and encouragement as always! Enjoy the new release :)</p>

<div class="toc-back-to-top"><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></div><h2 id="Known_issues">2.2. Known issues</h2>

<p>Being really open about our project, we have never hidden the fact that some things, sometimes, do not work in Aegir. Our <a href="http://drupal.org/project/issues?text=&amp;projects=provision%2C%20hosting%2C%20hostslave%2C%20eldir%2C%20Hostmaster%20%28Aegir%29&amp;status=Open&amp;priorities=All&amp;categories=All">issue trackers</a> are public, and we've made it a point of honor not only to document clearly what is wrong in our releases as soon as we find out about it, but also to reroll new releases when we fix it.</p>

<p>That being said, 2.0 still has a number of issues and design flaws. This is the list of <a href="https://drupal.org/project/issues?text=&amp;projects=provision,+hosting,+hostslave,+eldir,+Hostmaster+(Aegir)&amp;status=Open&amp;priorities=4&amp;categories=All">all issues marked "major" in the queue right now</a>. Most issues are now likely to be fixed in the 3.x development branch, and unlikely to be backported unless considered critical.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>hosting-queued</code> doesn't get properly re-enabled on upgrades, see <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2114675">#2114675</a> for a workaround.</li>
<li>Ubuntu saucy has some changes in apache config wich breaks Aegir <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2155705">#2155705</a></li>
<li>previous Debian packages may remove the <code>aegir.conf</code> symlink before being upgraded. this is fixed in 2.0 but will occur (it's inevitable) during upgrade. details and simple workaround in <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2121263">#2121263</a></li>

<h2 id="Security_improvements_for_nginx">1. Security improvements for nginx</h2>

<p>Previously, Aegir stored SSL cipher and protocol settings per site in Nginx virtualhost configuration files. This included the enabling of SSLv3, which is vulnerable to POODLE attacks [1].</p>

<p>Because these settings were stored via templates, permanently removing SSLv3 support on Aegir-based Nginx SSL environments was not possible. These settings have now been removed from the templates that generate Nginx virtualhost files under Aegir. If you wish to either re-enable SSLv3, or otherwise alter SSL cipher and protocol settings in Nginx, we recommend you do so in the http {} context (e.g, in /etc/nginx/nginx.conf), which are applied globally and are never manipulated by Aegir.</p>

<p>Sites that were running on Nginx and had SSL enabled, should be re-verified to remove those settings.</p>

<p>Apache users (including those using SSL) were not affected.</p>

<div class="toc-back-to-top"><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></div><h2 id="Installing_and_upgrading">2. Installing and upgrading</h2>

<p>The canonical source of installation documentation is on the community site at:</p>

<pre><code>http://community.aegirproject.org/installing
</code></pre>

<p>In a similar fashion, the upgrade documentation is at:</p>

<pre><code>http://community.aegirproject.org/upgrading
</code></pre>

<p>Within those sections, you'll find step-by-step instructions for performing both <a href="../../../../../upgrading/manual/index.html">manual</a> and <a href="../../../../../upgrading/script/index.html">automatic</a> upgrade processes.</p>

<p>It is still imperative that you read the the <a href="../../../../../upgrading/path/index.html">upgrade path and version-specific information</a> and follow all version-specific upgrade instructions before trying to run the upgrade script or manual upgrade.</p>

<p><strong>N.B.</strong> <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2146977">Issue #2146977: Broken backward compatibility with IP based vhosts</a> may affect those upgrading from 1.x. It appears that running 'verify' tasks on all sites should resolve the issue.</p>

<div class="toc-back-to-top"><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></div><h2 id="Need_help">3. Need help?</h2>

<p>If you struggle to install or upgrade your Aegir system, you have a number of options available to you for getting help.</p>

<p>Consult this page for more information: <a href="../../../../../help/index.html" title="http://community.aegirproject.org/help">http://community.aegirproject.org/help</a></p>

<p>Thanks to our awesome <a href="../../../../../index.html">community</a> for their help, support and encouragement as always! Enjoy the new release :)</p>

<div class="toc-back-to-top"><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></div><h2 id="Known_issues">4. Known issues</h2>

<p>Being really open about our project, we have never hidden the fact that some things, sometimes, do not work in Aegir. Our <a href="http://drupal.org/project/issues?text=&amp;projects=provision%2C%20hosting%2C%20hostslave%2C%20eldir%2C%20Hostmaster%20%28Aegir%29&amp;status=Open&amp;priorities=All&amp;categories=All">issue trackers</a> are public, and we've made it a point of honor not only to document clearly what is wrong in our releases as soon as we find out about it, but also to reroll new releases when we fix it.</p>

<p>That being said, 2.2 still has a number of issues and design flaws. This is the list of <a href="https://drupal.org/project/issues?projects=provision%2C+hosting%2C+hostslave%2C+eldir%2C+Hostmaster+%28Aegir%29&amp;priorities=300">all issues marked "major" in the queue right now</a>. Most issues are now likely to be fixed in the 3.x development branch, and unlikely to be backported unless considered critical.</p>

<p>As mentioned in the previous section, <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2146977">Issue #2146977: Broken backward compatibility with IP based vhosts</a> is still listed as a 'critical' issue against the 2.x branch. However, it should only affect those upgrading from 1.x, and has a fairly simple work-around. If you come across this behaviour during your upgrade, please post a comment to the issue, so we can confirm that it still exists.</p>

    </h2>
  
      <div class='node-content clear-block prose'>
      <p>The Aegir team is is pleased to announce the fifth release candidate for the upcoming Aegir 2.0 release!</p>

<p>This release ships a <em>ton</em> of bugfixes we have found in RC4. We also finalised subdirectory support which, while it still has <a href="#">some issues</a>, is now actually working correctly, even on multiple servers. The IP allocation code for SSL on multiple servers was also fixed, making this probably the most solid multi-server Aegir release ever. We also did some API cleanups that seemed necessary before the final 2.0 release.</p>

<p>Finally, we should also mentionned that the install process was significantly sped up thanks to the use of Drupal.org distributions to ship a single tarball for the hostmaster platform instead of using a makefile to build it from its parts all the times. During out tests, the platform <code>make</code> step went from 60 seconds to 1.5 seconds, an amazing improvement!</p>

<h1>Installing and upgrading</h1>

<p>The canonical source of installation documentation is on the community site at:</p>

<pre><code>http://community.aegirproject.org/installing
</code></pre>

<p>In a similar fashion, the upgrade documentation is:</p>

<pre><code>http://community.aegirproject.org/upgrading
</code></pre>

<p>Within those sections you'll find step-by-step instructions for performing both <a href="../../../../../upgrading/manual/index.html">manual</a> and <a href="../../../../../upgrading/script/index.html">automatic</a> upgrade processes, with <code>2.x</code>-specific instructions outlined in <strong>bold</strong>.</p>

<p>It is still imperative that you read the the <a href="../../../../../upgrading/path/index.html">upgrade path and version-specific information</a> and follow all version-specific upgrade instructions before trying to run the upgrade script or manual upgrade. You should be able to upgrade to 2.x releases from any release in the 1.x series, but it's better to upgrade to the latest 1.x release first.</p>

<h1>Known issues</h1>

<p>Those are the critical bugs that were found in this release that you may encounter and should watch out for.</p>

<ul>
<li>There was a problem in the Debian package, the original uploads were missing some critical files (subdir support and some makefiles). This was fixed in an intermediate package named <code>2.0~rc5.1</code>.</li>
<li>If <code>/var/aegir</code> is a symlink, it will be destroyed, see <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2118857">issue #2118857</a> for a workaround.</li>
<li><code>hosting-queued</code> doesn't get properly re-enabled on upgrades, see <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2114675">#2114675</a> for a workaround.</li>
<li>Some upgrades fail with mysterious redirection failures, see <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2118061">#2118061</a> for details.</li>
<li>Some upgrades may loop over one of the update_N() functions, see <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2118917">#2118917</a> for details and workaround.</li>
<li>Upgrading through Debian packages removes the <code>aegir.conf</code> Apache configuration file, dropping all sites, during the upgrade, see <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2121263">#2121263</a>.</li>
<li>Ubuntu sausy has some changes in apache config wich breaks Aegir <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2155705">#2155705</a></li>
</ul>

      <p>An error in the manual portion of our <a href="../../../../../content/release-process/index.html">release process</a> resulted in the incorrect version of the code-base being built. See the <a href="../../../../../2/index-8.html">release notes for 2.0-rc3</a> for relevant changes since 2.0-rc2.</p>

<h1>Known bugs</h1>

<p>In addition to those listed in the <a href="../../../../../2/index-8.html">release notes for 2.0-rc3</a>, note that some people have experienced problems with downloading a patch in the main Aegir makefile. This is most likely due to problems with drupal.org's SSL certificate. If you are experiencing such an issue, there is a simple work-around: edit the aegir.make file in the provision/ directory to make the path use http:// instead of https://.</p>

<p>For a Debian-based system (including Ubuntu), this would look something like:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo vi /usr/bin/drush/commands/provision/aegir.make
</code></pre>

<p>For 'manual' installs on other OS's, it would probably be:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo vi /var/aegir/provision/aegir.make
</code></pre>

<p>Change the line:</p>

<pre><code>projects[drupal][patch][] = "https://drupal.org/files/common.inc_6.28.patch"
</code></pre>

<p>to read:</p>

<pre><code>projects[drupal][patch][] = "http://drupal.org/files/common.inc_6.28.patch"
</code></pre>

<p>Then re-run the install. On Debian/Ubuntu machines:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install aegir2
</code></pre>

<p>On manually installed systems (CentOS, etc.) as the aegir user:</p>

<pre><code>$ drush hostmaster-install
</code></pre>

</ul></div><p>The Aegir team is pleased to announce the third release candidate for the upcoming Aegir 2.0 release.</p>

<p>This release mainly fixes a couple critical bugs in 2.0-rc2 that were causing problems when sites were being cloned or renamed. We've added a couple small features, such as additional options during hostmaster-install, and allowing the redirect to the Welcome page to be turned off. Also, we've made a small addition to the API, in that there is now a hook available (<code>hook_provision_drupal_create_directories_alter()</code>) to allow altering the directories created when a site installed.</p>

<p>In order to better support PHP 5.4, we have added a patch to Drupal core to suppress E_STRICT warnings. These were harmless, but annoying. They were caused by a changed in PHP error-reporting in PHP 5.4, and the Views module's maintainers' desire to remain backward compatible with PHP 4. For more details, see: <a href="http://drupal.org/node/2060727">#2060727: Patch Drupal core to suppress E_STRICT warnings on PHP5.4.</a></p>

<p>A number of pending issues require a new stable release of Drush (5.10), so we will work with the maintainers to help get a new release out.</p>

<h1>Known issues</h1>

<p>Our release process is still done by hand instead of being more automated because we can't use our aegir distribution as core (<a href="https://drupal.org/node/1991764">issue #1991764</a>).</p>

<p><a href="https://drupal.org/node/1931000">Issue #1931000: Missing drush backend output in frontend log</a> has been fixed, but may require a <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2025527#comment-7566747">patch to Drush</a> for the use of hosting-queued.</p>

<p>Subdirectory support is still very preliminary and needs a number of issues to be fixed before completion, see <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2046167">#2046167</a> for details. Note that this will not block a stable release, since this feature is 'experimental', and additional re-factoring can occur during the stable release cycle.</p>

</ul></div><p>The Aegir team is pleased to announce the second release candidate for the upcoming Aegir 2.0 release.</p>

<p>This release mainly fixes our project makefile that, due to an error in our build process, did not pull in the latest code. As a result, installing 2.0-rc1 actually installed a 2.0-beta2 codebase. While changes between 2.0-rc1 and 2.0-rc2 have otherwise been minimal, we invite you to explore all the new features and bugfixes in <a href="../../../../../2/index-10.html">2.0-rc1</a>.</p>

<p>Note that we have taken this opportunity to update our external dependencies, as well.</p>

<h1>Known issues</h1>

<p>Our release process is still done by hand instead of automated because we can't use our aegir distribution as core (<a href="https://drupal.org/node/1991764">issue #1991764</a>).</p>

<p><a href="https://drupal.org/node/1931000">Issue #1931000: Missing drush backend output in frontend log</a> has been fixed, but may require a <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2025527#comment-7566747">patch to Drush</a> for the use of hosting-queued.</p>

<p>Subdirectory support is still very preliminary and needs those issues to be fixed before completion, see <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2046167">#2046167</a> for details.</p>

<p><strike><a href="https://drupal.org/node/2046783">Issue #2046783: Task dialogs won't open after clearing the cache</a> was the result of updating our dependencies. Refreshing the page is usually sufficient to make modal dialogs work again.</strike> It looks like this was probably specific to the development environment, as we can no longer reproduce it.</p>

<p>A critical bug was discovered: <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2055949">Issue #2055949: Migrate drops wrong database when domain name changes</a>. It has been fixed in 6.x-2.x, and a <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2055949#comment-7713571">patch for 2.0-rc2</a> is available.</p>

</ul></div><p>The Aegir team is pleased to announce the first release candidate for the upcoming Aegir 2.0 release.</p>

<p>This release mainly targets a few critical bugs that were found in the second beta, mostly related to ongoing Views, Drush integration and access control. We also introduce a number of new features and finally drop support for provisioning Drupal 5 sites completely (for real this time!). Along the way, we did quite a bit of API cleanup.</p>

<p>While we are in feature freeze, we have continued to add some UI improvements, since they don't affect the API. We've added some long-standing UI enhancements, and fixed a number of bugs in the views integration and other usability problems, as well as overhauling our access control. Significant improvements to the package-management system have also been introduced.</p>

<p>Our only remaining critical bugs are basically waiting on a new release of Drush, upgrade testing on Nginx and some contrib upgrade guidance documentation. If no other critical bugs are discovered during the time it takes us to fix these, we should move on to a full release of Aegir 2.0!</p>

</ul></div><p>The Aegir team is pleased to announce the second stabilization (beta) release of the Aegir 2.x branch.</p>

<p>This release mainly targets a few critical bugs that were found in the first beta, namely IP allocation on non-SSL and non-cluster sites which was completely broken and bugs the Debian package. We also introduce a few new features and finally drop support for provisionning Drupal 5 sites completely.</p>

<p>While we are in feature freeze, we have continued to add some UI improvements, since they don't affect the API. We've added some long-standing UI enhancements, and fixed a number of bugs in the views integration and other usability problems.</p>

<p>We are down to only one active critical bug. If no other critical bugs are discovered during the time it takes us to fix it, we should move on to our first release candidate!</p>

<h1>Known issues</h1>

<p>Our release process is still done by hand instead of automated because we can't use our aegir distribution as core (<a href="https://drupal.org/node/1991764">issue #1991764</a>)</p>

<p><a href="https://drupal.org/node/1931000">Issue #1931000: Missing drush backend output in frontend log</a> has been fixed, but may require a <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2025527#comment-7566747">patch to Drush</a> for the use of hosting-queued.</p>

<p>Subdirectory support is still very preliminary and needs those issues to be fixed before completion:</p>

<ul>
<li>Nginx support missing (<a href="https://drupal.org/node/2020091">issue #2020091</a>)</li>
<li>If <code>example.com/foo</code> is created, the <code>example.com</code> virtual will be overwritten and the site inaccessible under that domain (<a href="https://drupal.org/node/2020089">issue #2020089</a>)</li>
<li>Multi-server support is untested (<a href="https://drupal.org/node/2020079">issue #2020079</a>)</li>
<li>Code needs to be refactored to the new 2.x API (<a href="https://drupal.org/node/2020075">issue #2020075</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The move to Views has highlighted some additional issues:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://drupal.org/node/2025355">#2025355: view platform' permission broken</a></li>
<li><a href="https://drupal.org/node/2005310">#2005310: No actions available on platforms view</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Fixing <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2027269">#2027269: warnings and errors in front-end pre- and post- hooks are ignored for task status</a> required a new Drush commandfile, and thus a 'drush cc drush' if upgrade between an alpha/beta release and HEAD.</p>

<p>The debian package <em>still</em> doesn't properly configure the webserver, a patch has been committed and a workaround is available in <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2040285">issue #2040285</a>.</p>

</ul></div><p>The Aegir team is pleased to announce the first stabilization (beta) release of the Aegir 2.x branch, after nearly 3 weeks of development since our second alpha release. While we had expected an additional alpha release prior to the beta cycle, development on outstanding features went smoother than foreseen. We've added some significant features, and fixed a couple bugs and (again) made some important improvements to our API.</p>

<p>This release marks our feature freeze. The intention is to limit any further changes to only critical and major bug fixes. However, exceptions may be granted on a case by case basis. Our development efforts will now move to tackling all release critical bugs. Once all of these are fixed, we'll move on to our release candidate (RC) phase. That said, we expect this release to be sufficiently stable that we intend to run it in production at Koumbit soon.</p>

<h1>Release overview</h1>

<p>This release introduces a major new feature into Aegir core: support for installing sites in subdirectories (example.com/foo, example.com/bar, etc.). This has been our number one feature request from higher education institutions, and so we hope that this will enable greater adoption within that sector. While categorized as an "experimental" feature, we feel our approach is sufficiently strong that we're considering merging this into our core site functionality.</p>

<p>Additional new features include a nice homepage, fixes to SSL support and IP allocation on clusters, and we've added a couple new roles.</p>

<p>We've also tackled a number of bugs, especially in the Debian package, which now supports installing Aegir on Nginx servers. We've also fixed some issues introduced with the new views code, and improved nginx support.</p>

<p>The project's Debian repo now includes Drush 5.9, and we have migrated the 'aegir2' packages to the Testing repository.</p>

<h1>Known issues</h1>

<ul>
<li>the debian package shows a lot of garbage when installing from scratch, which is almost harmless except that we don't see the login URL, use <code>drush @hostmaster uli</code> to get a new one, fixed in <a href="http://drupal.org/node/2002076">issue #2002076</a></li>
<li>SSL support was severely broken for single servers and could lead to loss of the SSL certificate copies when a non-SSL site is installed. See commits f0980e0..9b86038 in Provision for fixes. (fixed in issue <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2023621">#2023621</a>)</li>
<li>the Debian package is severely broken - in most configuration (e.g. clean installs but not upgrade) the install will just fail with a permission denied. See commits <a href="http://drupalcode.org/project/provision.git/commit/d4efa37">d4efa37</a> and <a href="http://drupalcode.org/project/provision.git/commit/56d1718">56d1718</a> for fixes.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are related to drush:</p>

<ul>
<li>some warnings and errors may not show up in Aegir's task logs, making it believe tasks succeeded when the actually failed. this affects only hosting-queued. (<a href="https://drupal.org/node/1931000">issue #1931000</a> / <a href="https://drupal.org/node/1982502">issue #1982502</a>)</li>
<li>our release process is now done by hand instead of automated because we can't use our aegir distribution as core (<a href="https://drupal.org/node/1991764">issue #1991764</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Subdirectory support is still very preliminary and needs those issues to be fixed before completion:</p>

<ul>
<li>Nginx support missing (<a href="https://drupal.org/node/2020091">issue #2020091</a>)</li>
<li>If <code>example.com/foo</code> is created, the <code>example.com</code> virtual will be overwritten and the site inaccessible under that domain (<a href="https://drupal.org/node/2020089">issue #2020089</a>)</li>
<li>Multi-server support is untested (<a href="https://drupal.org/node/2020079">issue #2020079</a>)</li>
<li>Code needs to be refactored to the new 2.x API (<a href="https://drupal.org/node/2020075">issue #2020075</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h1>API changes</h1>

<ul>
<li>Multiple files can be managed in a single context now (see <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2000038">issue #2000038</a>, <a href="https://drupal.org/node/1784108">issue #1784108</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h1>New features</h1>

<ul>
<li>Support for installing in subdirectories (<a href="https://drupal.org/node/705026">issue #705026</a>)</li>
<li>Proper homepage on startup so non-logged-in users don't see an error page, and new users have basic instructions (<a href="https://drupal.org/node/1793740">issue #1793740</a>)</li>
<li>SSL support for clusters should now work properly (<a href="https://drupal.org/node/2000964">issue #2000964</a>)</li>
<li>New roles added: 'aegir platform manager', 'aegir administrator' (<a href="https://drupal.org/node/1403208">issue #1403208</a>)</li>
<li>Convert list of platforms to use views (<a href="https://drupal.org/node/1876350">Issue #1876350</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h1>Bugfixes</h1>

<ul>
<li>Debian package support for nginx was severely broken <a href="http://drupal.org/node/2001142">issue #2001142</a></li>
<li>the views bulk operations version shipped with alpha2 had security issues, see <a href="http://drupal.org/node/2001964">issue #2001964</a></li>
<li>an update hook was incorrectly named, and has since been fixed. The updates should not be destructive, but may output errors.</li>
<li>Placement of a number of our new Views-based blocks was omitted from the install profile, and so won't appear on a fresh install. These can be manually placed on the blocks page.</li>
<li>fix warning "Invalid argument supplied for foreach()" (<a href="https://drupal.org/node/2005698">issue #2005698</a>)</li>

      <div class='node-content clear-block prose'>
      <p>The Aegir team is pleased to announce the second preview (alpha) release of the Aegir 2.x branch, after nearly 3 months of development since our first alpha release. We've squashed a number of tenacious bugs, added some nifty features, and made some important improvements to our API. We expect at least one more alpha release before we call a feature-freeze, and begin out stabilizing and cleanup (beta) release cycle.</p>

<p>During this release cycle, we also began work on Aegir 3, a more-or-less straight port of Aegir 2 to Drupal 7. We continue to sync changes in 2.x to our 3.x branch, and look forward to continuing the port (and beginning to add new features) as soon as we've released our first stable 2.x release.</p>

<p>Our next alpha release will target getting sub-site support (example.com/site1, example.com/site2, etc.) into Aegir core as an experimental feature. This has been our number one feature request from higher education institutions, and so we intend to incorporate it into Aegir 2, in order to enable greater adoption within that sector. We have a fairly detailed implementation plan, and so feel confident that we can incorporate this major feature, in fairly short order.</p>

<h1>Release overview</h1>

<p>This release features improvements to the IP management mechanisms that were broken in the last alpha1 release. We now manage IP addresses individually, and check if an IP is in use before allowing it to be deleted.</p>

<p>We also finally leave the files alone on spokes in the multi-server model, a long-standing bug in the 1.x series that led to data loss. A lot of work was done to standardize the Nginx configuration to allow for simpler, yet optional, configurations that leave the admin in charge of choosing the optimisation methods.</p>

<p>Also, we've moved Hosting and Eldir back to their own projects, and are now included via our makefiles. This simplifies building custom install profiles, though it complicates our release process somewhat. We've also added a drupal-org.make that will eventually allow proper distribution bundling of Aegir.</p>

<p>Finally, we've moved to using Views and View Bulk Operations for our lists of sites, platforms and packages. While there remain some rough edges, this will allow much easier customization of our principal UIs. It has also significantly reduced the custom code we have to maintain, in favour of exported Views, which simplifies maintenance.</p>

<h1>Known issues</h1>

    </h2>
  
      <div class='node-content clear-block prose'>
      <p>The Aegir team is pleased to announce the first preview release (<em>alpha</em>) of the Aegir 2.x branch, after almost 2 years of development. We have been pretty busy with the maintenance of the 1.x branch, so development has been sometimes intermittent, but it is not over yet!</p>

<p>This release is only a first of a series of alpha releases that are tailored to make upcoming changes available to a wider audience than people ready to install from git, but also to make features more widely available and tested. More alpha releases will be published on a more regular basis in the weeks to come as more features from the <a href="../../../../1829/index.html">new provisional roadmap</a> are implemented. We are still considering the following:</p>

<p>We have set the following priorities:</p>

<ol>
<li>subsite support (<a href="https://drupal.org/node/705026">#705026</a>) - now that mig5 did most of the work ;)</li>
<li>nginx cleanup (<a href="https://drupal.org/node/1635596">#1635596</a>, <a href="https://drupal.org/node/1635622">#1635622</a>, <a href="https://drupal.org/node/1622846">#1622846</a>, <a href="https://drupal.org/node/1635586">#1635586</a>, <a href="https://drupal.org/node/1608910">#1608910</a>) and Nginx Debian package (<a href="https://drupal.org/node/1348560">#1348560</a>)</li>
<li>files/ sync settled (<a href="https://drupal.org/node/1083366">#1083366</a>)</li>
<li><STRIKE>SSL code cleanup (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/941870">#941870</a>, <a href="../../../../../discuss/first-quarterly-report-aegir-funding-work/index.html#SSL_and_IP_allocation_work">see also this report</a>)</strike> - done! Now onto testing and fixing the actual bugs linked from <a href="http://drupal.org/node/941870">#941870</a></li>
</ol>

<p>We would like to get those in 2.x, but since no one has really started significant work on those, we are more likely to simply postpone those to 3.x at this point.</p>

<ol>
<li>standard archive support (<a href="https://drupal.org/node/1138882">#1138882</a>, <a href="../../../../../roadmap/2/index.html#Standard_archive_support">original roadmap description</a>)</li>
<li>intersite security (the infamous <a href="https://drupal.org/node/762138">#762138</a>)</li>
<li>more intelligence in spokes (<a href="../../../../../roadmap/2/index.html#From_a_hub-spoke_to_a_mesh_model">original roadmap description</a>)</li>
</ol>

<p>Also, since every single attempt at providing a proper timeline for the final 2.0 release has failed miserably, we'll just stop trying our luck and just give up on a formal timeline. Instead, we'll just do the freaking work. :) Also remember that the <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1261030">port to Drupal 7</a> has been <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1261030">postponed to Aegir 3</a>. Aegir 1 and 2 both support provisionning Drupal 7 sites, but the frontend is running Drupal 6. We are aiming for a "straight port" (no rewrite) of the frontend for Aegir 3.</p>

<h2 id="Major_changes">1. Major changes</h2>

<p>This first alpha already packs a lot of changes.

</ul>

<p>A more detailed log of bugfixes and improvements is available below.</p>

<div class="toc-back-to-top"><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></div><h2 id="Major_API_changes">2. Major API changes</h2>

<p>Those changes are, as usual, more explicitly documented in the <a href="../../../../../upgrading/path/index.html">upgrade path</a> documentation.</p>

<ul>
<li>hosting-task now needs a <code>--force</code> argument to run a non-queued task</li>
<li>functions that were deprecated in 1.x are now removed</li>
<li>the <code>email</code> and <code>client_email</code> database fields are now removed from client and site node types</li>
<li>numerous changes to the IP allocation and SSL management code</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that the 2.x API is still not considered stable and may change without warning until 2.x is fully stabilized, see <a href="../../../../../content/release-process/index.html">our release process</a> for more information.</p>

<div class="toc-back-to-top"><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></div><h2 id="Installing_and_upgrading">3. Installing and upgrading</h2>

<p>The canonical source of installation documentation is on the community site at:</p>

<pre><code>http://community.aegirproject.org/installing
</code></pre>

<p>In a similar fashion, the upgrade documentation is:</p>

<pre><code>http://community.aegirproject.org/upgrading
</code></pre>

<p>Within those sections you'll find step-by-step instructions for performing both <a href="../../../../../upgrading/manual/index.html">manual</a> and <a href="../../../../../upgrading/script/index.html">automatic</a> upgrade processes.</p>

<p>Note that you should upgrade to the latest 1.x release (currently: <a href="../../../../../1/index-3.html">1.9</a>) before attempting the upgrade to 2.x. This is especially important if you are running a pre-1.0 release (poor you!).</p>

<p>It is still imperative that you read the <a href="../../../../../upgrading/path/index.html">upgrade path and version-specific information</a> and follow all version-specific upgrade instructions before trying to run the upgrade script or manual upgrade.</p>

<h2 id="Installing_and_upgrading">1. Installing and upgrading</h2>

<p>The canonical source of installation documentation is on the community site at:</p>

<pre><code>http://community.aegirproject.org/installing
</code></pre>

<p>In a similar fashion, the upgrade documentation is:</p>

<pre><code>http://community.aegirproject.org/upgrading
</code></pre>

<p>Within those sections you'll find step-by-step instructions for performing both <a href="../../../../../upgrading/manual/index.html">manual</a> and <a href="../../../../../upgrading/script/index.html">automatic</a> upgrade processes.</p>

<p>It is still imperative that you read the the <a href="../../../../../upgrading/path/index.html">upgrade path and version-specific information</a> and follow all version-specific upgrade instructions before trying to run the upgrade script or manual upgrade. This especially applies to users upgrading from releases prior to 0.4-alpha8, including 0.3.</p>

<p>For users coming from the 0.4 betas or rc releases, there are unlikely to be any version-specific manual steps required to upgrade, but you should make a habit of reading them anyway just to make sure. No-one likes a nasty surprise!</p>

<div class="toc-back-to-top"><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></div><h2 id="Need_help">2. Need help?</h2>

<p>If you struggle to install or upgrade your Aegir system, you have a number of options available to you for getting help.</p>

<p>Consult this page for more information: <a href="../../../../../help/index.html" title="http://community.aegirproject.org/help">http://community.aegirproject.org/help</a></p>

<p>Thanks to our awesome <a href="../../../../../index.html">community</a> for their help, support and encouragement as always! Enjoy the new release :)</p>

<div class="toc-back-to-top"><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></div><h2 id="Known_issues">3. Known issues</h2>

<p>Upgrades may fail if the SSL certificates are actually symlinks to files not readable by Aegir, a rare but legitimate use-case. A fix is available in git, see <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2046249">#2046249</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Aegir 1.x depends on Drush 4.5 or 4.6, which are available <em>only</em> in Debian squeeze backports (old stable!), which may make fresh installs or careless upgrades impossible. To workaround this issue, install the Drush package directly from backports:</p>

<pre><code>wget <a href="http://backports.debian.org/debian-backports/pool/main/d/drush/drush_4.5-2~bpo60+1_all.deb" title="http://backports.debian.org/debian-backports/pool/main/d/drush/drush_4.5-2~bpo60+1_all.deb">http://backports.debian.org/debian-backports/pool/main/d/drush/drush_4.5...</a>
dpkg -i drush_4.5-2~bpo60+1_all.deb
</code></pre>

<p>See <a href="http://packages.debian.org/squeeze-backports/all/drush/download">this page</a> for other mirrors.</p>

<p>Because of a little fumble in the <a href="../../../../../2/index-9.html">2.0-rc2</a> release process documentation, a development build of Aegir 1.x has overwritten the 1.10 official release in the stable repository. Since that development build only has the fix for <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2046249">#2046249</a>, we haven't restored the previous build and thefore the version number of the Debian package is <code>1.10+246.efcd0a3</code> instead of <code>1.10</code>. However, this also means that the hostmaster platform directory will be named <code>hostmaster-1.x</code> instead of <code>hostmaster-1.10</code>, which will make upgrades to other development releases require manual creation of the platform.</p>

<h2 id="Installing_and_upgrading">1. Installing and upgrading</h2>

<p>The canonical source of installation documentation is on the community site at:</p>

<pre><code>http://community.aegirproject.org/installing
</code></pre>

<p>In a similar fashion, the upgrade documentation is:</p>

<pre><code>http://community.aegirproject.org/upgrading
</code></pre>

<p>Within those sections you'll find step-by-step instructions for performing both <a href="../../../../../upgrading/manual/index.html">manual</a> and <a href="../../../../../upgrading/script/index.html">automatic</a> upgrade processes.</p>

<p>It is still imperative that you read the the <a href="../../../../../upgrading/path/index.html">upgrade path and version-specific information</a> and follow all version-specific upgrade instructions before trying to run the upgrade script or manual upgrade. This especially applies to users upgrading from releases prior to 0.4-alpha8, including 0.3.</p>

<p>For users coming from the 0.4 betas or recent rc releases, there are unlikely to be any version-specific manual steps required to upgrade, but you should make a habit of reading them anyway just to make sure. No-one likes a nasty surprise!</p>

<p>Also note that 2.x development is moving ahead with Drush 5 and Drupal 7 support, along with code refactoring and other features. Debian package builds will be available shortly in a separate Debian repository.</p>

<p>We also want to take this opportunity to welcome to our <a href="../../../../../maintainers/index.html">core team</a> omega8cc, a long time contributor that will now be responsible for the maintenance of the Nginx code. Welcome on board Grace!</p>

Further details can be found the in original announcement of this change: <a href="../../../../../discuss/debian-archive-migrated-debianaegirprojectorg/index.html">Debian archive migrated to debian.aegirproject.org</a>.</p>

</ul></div><p>The Aegir team is happy to release the third stable release in the 1.x branch. We have found only one critical bug (in Nginx support) but have fixed so many little bugs that we figured it was about time to make a new release.</p>

<p>The major changes from 1.1 are that we now support the wget cron method for D7, and have fixed a lot of issues in the Nginx support. In addition, there is now the ability to "purge" platforms that Aegir might not otherwise recognize as eligible for deletion, and have robots.txt on a per-site basis. Finally, the "wget" support for cron.php has been rewritten with drupal_http_request(), so it's much faster and will detect errors properly - no more discrepancies between Aegir's idea of when cron was ran and the site's.</p>

<p>We've put in place a continuous integration server (Jenkins), which has allowed us to start automated testing of the Debian packages. This helps to ensure that automated installation of the software is stable. People wishing to test the latest development version of the 1.x tree can now install packages from the "unstable" repository; more information can be found here: <a href="../../../../../debian/index.html#Package_versionning" title="http://community.aegirproject.org/debian#Package_versionning">http://community.aegirproject.org/debian#Package_versionning</a></p>

<p>While not specific to this release, we have made extensive improvements to the documentation that can be found at <a href="../../../../../handbook/index.html" title="http://community.aegirproject.org/handbook">http://community.aegirproject.org/handbook</a>, as well as API documentation on <a href="http://api.aegirproject.org/" title="http://api.aegirproject.org">http://api.aegirproject.org</a></p>

<p>Also, we've begun to accept donations in order to cover various project costs. As an open source project, we need the support of the community to ensure ongoing development and support. Koumbit is pleased to provide administrative support for this, and you can find the donation page on their site: <a href="http://membres.koumbit.org/en/civicrm/contribute/transact?reset=1&amp;id=5" title="http://membres.koumbit.org/en/civicrm/contribute/transact?reset=1&amp;id=5">http://membres.koumbit.org/en/civicrm/contribute/transact?reset=1&amp;id=5</a>, which is also linked to directly from the front page of the community site.</p>

<p>The canonical source of installation documentation is on the community site at:</p>

<p>In a similar fashion, the upgrade documentation is:</p>

<pre><code>http://community.aegirproject.org/upgrading

<p>Within those sections you'll find step-by-step instructions for performing both <a href="../../../../../upgrading/manual/index.html">manual</a> and <a href="../../../../../upgrading/script/index.html">automatic</a> upgrade processes.</p>

<p>It is still imperative that you read the the <a href="../../../../../upgrading/path/index.html">upgrade path and version-specific information</a> and follow all version-specific upgrade instructions before trying to run the upgrade script or manual upgrade. This especially applies to users upgrading from releases prior to 0.4-alpha8, including 0.3.</p>

<p>For users coming from the 0.4 betas or recent rc releases, there are unlikely to be any version-specific manual steps required to upgrade, but you should make a habit of reading them anyway just to make sure. No-one likes a nasty surprise!</p>

</ul></div><p>The Aegir team is very pleased to announce the first official stable release of Aegir - 1.0. While it's been a mostly "open secret" that most of our releases are production ready, this one has been tested through no less than 15 alpha releases, 2 beta releases and 7 release candidates, for a grand total 24 test releases before we deliver this stable version.</p>

<p>Speaking of open secrets, here's a word from our founder, <a href="https://drupal.org/node/956624">Adrian Rossouw</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Aegir 1.0 release marks the end of my association with the Aegir project, as I am officially stepping down as project leader, handing the reins to Antoine, Miguel and the rest of the team.</p>
  
  <p>Nearly 8 years ago, I left my job to help found Bryght, one of the first Drupal service companies, with the intention of building a hosted service with Drupal. I had a dream, and that dream was called "hostmaster". Over the next several years, the system I developed to accomplish this dream evolved into Aegir.</p>
  
  <p>I started the Aegir project, in it's current form, out of a desire to ensure that my dream would be able to survive beyond my ability to dedicate myself to it. The very fact that I am writing this is evidence that it has succeeded beyond my wildest dreams.</p>
  
  <p>Aegir is bigger than just one person, and I am incredibly happy and proud of the progress made, so I feel completely comfortable leaving you in the hands of my very capable co-maintainers.</p>
  
  <p>Thank you to everybody for their support, and I wish nothing but the best for the project and it's future victories!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And thank you, Adrian, for this great project you have given to the Drupal community, it means a lot to us!</p>

<p>Now onto the release. This actual release isn't much different from the previous release candidates - you can see the list of changes from the previous <a href="../../../../../1/index-13.html">RC7 release</a> at the end of those notes. However, since this is our first major release in a long time, we figured it would be important to outline how things have changed since the old days of 0.3. For those of you who weren't there, back then installing Aegir was <em>hard</em>. There was no "clone", no SSL, no multiserver. You had to migrate sites one at a time and you had to create platforms yourself (no drush make!). We were still using CVS.</p>

<p>With 1.0, we have multiserver support, Debian packages, DNS, we're using git, drush make and we have a very dynamic <a href="../../../../../index.html">community</a> of users and shops using the project. We have <a href="../../../../../roadmap/2/index.html">ambitious goals for 2.0</a> and we're eager (pun intended) to start moving again! So if you were waiting for Aegir to be <strong>stable</strong>, <strong>easy to install</strong>, <strong>production-ready</strong>, now is the time. The 1.x branch will be well supported as a lot of shops are running it in production already. What are <em>you</em> waiting for?!</p>

<h2 id="Major_changes_in_this_release">1. Major changes in this release</h2>

<p>Since our last stable release (<a href="http://groups.drupal.org/aegir/0.3">0.3</a>) in august 2009, we've done an incredible amount of work. The code size nearly doubled as the development team and user base, although we don't clearly know yet how many installs there are out there.</p>

<p>We can already say that we've been pretty successful at fulfilling our <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/25841">release goals for 0.4</a> and the <a href="../../../../../roadmap/1/index.html">1.0 roadmap</a>. Even though we're <a href="https://drupal.org/project/issues/search?text=&amp;projects=&amp;assigned=&amp;submitted=&amp;participant=&amp;issue_tags_op=or&amp;issue_tags=aegir-1.0">missing bits and pieces</a>, especially in DNS, and multi-server support is not as robust as we'd like it to be, there's still space for improvements and bugfixes in the 1.x branch, and we'll also start on the <a href="../../../../../roadmap/2/index.html">2.0 roadmap</a> once this release is out the door.</p>

<p>The API changes since 0.3 are too numerous to list here. However, we are now committed to maintain the whole 1.x series with a stable API. There will be no change in the existing API, although we may add in some stuff if it is really necessary. All future API changes between 1.x and 2.x will be clearly defined so that third party module can be supported.</p>

<p>A documentation initiative has been launched to <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1111254">better document the Hostmaster API</a>. In addition, a dedicated <a href="http://api.aegirproject.org/">API site</a> (along the lines of api.drupal.org) has been put in place to ease exploring the code-base of the Aegir Project. Much work remains, so you can track progress or help out <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1111254#comment-4287518">here</a>.</p>

<p>Major changes to 1.x will not be committed unless they are first tested in 2.0 and merged back. We will however keep the branch opened for documentation fixes and non-invasive changes like performance enhancements and cosmetic changes to the frontend. Major problems and "aegirWTF" may also be corrected in the 1.x branch, after a shakedown in the 2.x branch.</p>

<p>From now on, major development will take place in the 2.x branch, which will be created shortly after this release. The <a href="../../../../../roadmap/2/index.html">roadmap for that branch is ambitious</a> but we'll tackle things one at a time, again on feature branches for major changes so that even that branch will stay stable throughout its development cycle. We will there keep in making stable alpha releases for your testing pleasure.</p>

<p>The canonical source of installation documentation is on the community site at:</p>

<pre><code>http://community.aegirproject.org/installing
</code></pre>

<p>In a similar fashion, the upgrade documentation is:</p>

<pre><code>http://community.aegirproject.org/upgrading

<p>Within those sections you'll find step-by-step instructions for performing both <a href="../../../../../upgrading/manual/index.html">manual</a> and <a href="../../../../../upgrading/script/index.html">automatic</a> upgrade processes.</p>

<p>It is still imperative that you read the the <a href="../../../../../upgrading/path/index.html">upgrade path and version-specific information</a> and follow all version-specific upgrade instructions before trying to run the upgrade script or manual upgrade. This especially applies to users upgrading from releases prior to 0.4-alpha8, including 0.3.</p>

<p>For users coming from the 0.4 betas or recent rc releases, there are unlikely to be any version-specific manual steps required to upgrade, but you should make a habit of reading them anyway just to make sure. No-one likes a nasty surprise!</p>

<p>Being really open about our project, we have never hidden the fact that some things, sometimes, do not work in Aegir. Our <a href="http://drupal.org/project/issues?text=&amp;projects=provision%2C%20hosting%2C%20hostslave%2C%20eldir%2C%20Hostmaster%20%28Aegir%29&amp;status=Open&amp;priorities=All&amp;categories=All">issue trackers</a> are public, and we've made it a point of honor not only to document clearly what is wrong in our releases as soon as we find out about it, but also to reroll new releases when we fix it.</p>

<p>That being said, 1.0 suffers from a number of significant issues and design flaws. This is the list of <a href="https://drupal.org/project/issues?text=&amp;projects=provision,+hosting,+hostslave,+eldir,+Hostmaster+(Aegir)&amp;status=Open&amp;priorities=4&amp;categories=All">all issues marked "major" in the queue right now</a>. Some of those issues can be fixed within the 1.x branch, some can only be fixed by refactoring, and so they will be fixed in 2.x.</p>

      <p>The Aegir team is very pleased to announce the <em>fifth</em> release candidate of Aegir 1.0!</p>

<p>This is a hotfix release to fix a major issue in the upgrade path. All users are strongly encouraged to skip the rc4 release and upgrade here instead.</p>

<h2>Changes in 1.0-rc5</h2>

<ul>
<li>fix the upgrade path (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/1118558">#1118558</a>)</li>
<li>fix upgrade.sh to have the right older version all the time and automatically detect drush (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/1117776">#1117776</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Known issues</h2>

<ul>
<li>Drupal 7 support is broken (hotfix available in <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1119850">#1119850</a>)</li>
<li>upgrade.sh is broken again, use <a href="http://drupalcode.org/project/provision.git/blob_plain/84e633b505df86b68823ad12458bfd837999751f:/upgrade.sh.txt">this version</a> instead until rc6 comes out</li>

<p>We have again found critical issues in rc3, detailed below, and a few key features that we wanted to slip into 1.0 that were just low-hanging fruits that deserved to be released. We hope this release candidate will be all shiny and without any critical issues so we can release it as 1.0.</p>

<p><em>Update</em>: because of a last minute API change, the upgrade path is broken and it is not recommended to upgrade to this release. A new release has been published, so use <a href="../../../../../1/index-15.html">1.0-rc5</a> instead. See <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1118558">#1118558</a> for more information.</p>

<h2>Key changes in 1.0-rc4</h2>

<ul>
<li>There is now a <code>~/clients</code> directory in which symlink are automatically created to allow easy access to all your client sites (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/1115960">#1115960</a>)</li>
<li>A variable is now set in <code>settings.php</code> (<code>aegir_api</code>) to allow contrib modules to inspect what Aegir version they are dealing with, if any. The setting is removed on export, that is, if dbcloaking is off (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/1027358">#1027358</a>)</li>
<li>We fixed a big regression where the mass migrate form stopped working in rc3 (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/1111532">#1111532</a>)</li>
<li>The <code>private</code> directory of Drupal 7 is now properly protected (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/1108810">#1108810</a>)</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../../../installing/debian/index.html">Debian package</a> has been tested over and over again and is now the prefered install method for people on Debian</li>
<li>Consequently, <code>install.sh</code> has been removed and the <a href="../../../../../installing/manual/index.html">manual install instructions</a> have been revamped to be clearer, see <a href="../../../../542/index.html">this post</a> for more information about the reasoning behind that change</li>
</ul>

<h2>Known issues</h2>

<ul>
<li>DNS has no access control - anybody can create any zone (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/922252">#922252</a>)</li>
<li>The site form suffers from some performance issues when you have a lot of platforms (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/955854">#955854</a>)</li>
<li>Cluster servers are probably broken right now (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/1016890">#1016890</a>)</li>
<li>Aliases are not persisted across Migrate, (Rename), Clone (provision-deploy) (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/1004526">#1004526</a>)</li>
<li>Upgrade path is broken (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/1118558">#1118558</a>)</li>

<h2>Installing and upgrading</h2>

<p>The canonical source of installation documentation has moved from the usual INSTALL.txt to the community site at:</p>

<pre><code>http://community.aegirproject.org/installing
</code></pre>

<p>In a similar fashion, the upgrade documentation has now been moved to the community site at</p>

<pre><code>http://community.aegirproject.org/upgrading
</code></pre>

<p>Within those sections you'll find step-by-step instructions for performing both manual and automatic upgrade processes. You can download the upgrade.sh.txt script from <a href="../../../../431/index.html" title="http://community.aegirproject.org/node/431">http://community.aegirproject.org/node/431</a>.</p>

<p>It is still imperative that you read the the Upgrade Guide (<a href="../../../../../upgrading/index.html" title="http://community.aegirproject.org/upgrading">http://community.aegirproject.org/upgrading</a>) and follow all version-specific upgrade instructions located at the end of the document before trying to run the upgrade script. This especially applies to users upgrading from before 0.4-alpha8, including 0.3.</p>

<p>For users coming from the 0.4 betas or rc1/2, there are unlikely to be any version-specific manual steps required to upgrade to 1.0-rc4, but you should make a habit of reading them anyway just to make sure. No-one likes a nasty surprise!</p>

<p>The upgrade.sh script attempts to backup the existing backend components, download new versions, and then run the hostmaster-migrate command. It assumes you are upgrading from the previous release (hostmaster-6.x-1.0-rc3). If you are not, you may have to edit the script to change the OLD_DRUPAL_DIR variable.</p>

<h2>Need help?</h2>

<p>If you struggle to install or upgrade your Aegir system, you have a number of options available to you for getting help.</p>

<p>The Aegir team is very pleased to announce the third release candidate of Aegir 1.0!</p>

<p>This is the third Release Candidate from which we will test fixes to critical bugs from rc2, as well as fix any additional critical bugs found since, until we have no criticals and will then roll out the official 1.0.</p>

<p>This release also includes a fix for a security vulnerability (see below). We recommend you upgrade your Aegir instance to apply this fix.</p>

<h2>Key changes in 1.0-rc3</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>A security vulnerability was fixed that prevents arbitrary configuration from being injected into Apache vhosts by way of the Site Aliases form. See <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1098304">#1098304</a></p></li>
<li><p>The 'Client' feature / node type has been significantly refactored and simplified, with the ultimate aim of hooking it into other CRM/databases (e.g. for LDAP support), and better Aegir-managed site/user security. This involved an exception to our current 'API freeze' for the sake of getting this important refactoring in. See <a href="../../../../521/index.html">this summary of the changes</a> this imposes</p></li>
<li><p>We've upgraded to use Drush 4.4 and Drush Make 2.2 on fresh installs and upgrades. These have been tested and should work without any problems.</p></li>

      <p>The Aegir team is very pleased to announce the second release candidate of Aegir 1.0!</p>

<p>Yes, you read that right: 1.0! We've decided to rename the 0.4 branch to 1.0.</p>

<p>This is the second Release Candidate from which we will test fixes to critical bugs from rc1, as well as fix any additional critical bugs found since, until we have no criticals and will then roll out the official 1.0.</p>

<h2>Key changes in 1.0-rc2</h2>

<p>There are a lot of bug fixes and features added into this release.</p>

<p>INSTALL.txt and UPGRADE.txt, along with the various architecture hints, and other developer docs, have been moved to the community site under:</p>

<pre><code>http://community.aegirproject.org/administrator-manual
</code></pre>

<p>The Aegir git repositories have moved back to drupal.org, we're back in the family!</p>

<p>We have fixed some key issues that were discovered during testing, including sites that were not put offline during migrations and data loss issues in multiserver migration. We have also worked on the upgrade path for legacy (pre alpha9) installs, which should be able to upgrade to this release directly.</p>

<p>Finally, we fixed a CSRF attack on the task form that allowed an attacker to force a user to run tasks on existing sites and platforms. This is non-critical as only tasks with no confirmation dialog (ie. safe tasks) could be triggered.</p>

<p>Also, we've moved to Drush Make 2.1!</p>

<h2>Known Issues</h2>

<li>DNS has no access control - anybody can create any zone (#922252)</li>
<li>The site form suffers from some performance issues when you have a lot of platforms (#955854)</li>

<h2>No Drush 4?</h2>

<p>Some people might be wondering why we haven't changed the install.sh or upgrade.sh scripts to fetch the latest Drush 4.2 release.</p>

<p>Drush 4.2 has a bug which breaks rsync and possibly other stuff when using multiserver.</p>

<p>It's been fixed in Drush, but we are awaiting a 4.3 release before we roll with it. If you see 4.3 come out, you can probably upgrade your Drush if you wish (we tested this morning and are in fact compatible with Drush HEAD at time of writing).</p>

<p>See this ticket for more: <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1041386" title="http://drupal.org/node/1041386">http://drupal.org/node/1041386</a></p>

<p>We are working with the Drush developers to attempt to 'sync' our releases in future, but we wanted to roll out rc2 to all you good folk sooner rather than later this time :)</p>

    </h2>
  
      <div class='node-content clear-block prose'>
      <p>The Aegir team is very pleased to announce the first release candidate of Aegir 0.4!</p>

<p>This is the first rc from which we will go into crazy bugfixing mode until we have no criticals and will then roll out the official 0.4.</p>

<h2>Key changes in 0.4-rc1</h2>

<p>There are a lot of bug fixes and features added into this release.</p>

<p>Significantly, a major data-loss bug was fixed in Multiserver environments, that was causing a remote site's 'files' directory contents to be deleted if those files didn't already exist on the 'master' copy of the site on the hostmaster system.</p>

<p>Also, we stopped hardcoding "$conf['cache'] = 1" in sites' settings.php, returning control over the caching function back to the user by way of:</p>

<ul>
<li>inserting the preferred setting into a file called 'local.settings.php' alongside the settings.php so it won't be clobbered by the template, or</li>
<li>same as above but in /var/aegir/config/includes/global.inc to set it globally for all sites, or</li>
<li>setting it in /admin/settings/performance on your site, and having that setting stick instead of being reset by the hardcode.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Known Issues</h2>

<ul>
<li>DNS has no access control - anybody can create any zone (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/922252">#922252</a>)</li>
<li>The site form suffers from some performance issues when you have a lot of platforms (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/955854">#955854</a>)</li>
<li>Cluster servers are probably broken right now (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/1016890">#1016890</a>)</li>
<li>Aliases are not persisted across Migrate, (Rename), Clone (provision-deploy) (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/1004526">#1004526</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installing and upgrading</h2>

<p>The canonical source of installation documentation is as usual the excellent <a href="http://git.aegirproject.org/?p=provision.git;a=blob_plain;f=docs/INSTALL.txt;hb=provision-0.4-rc1">INSTALL.txt</a>. The hostmaster and provision tarballs have the following checksums:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>provision-0.4-rc1.tgz: 6f4da4ba7dcfaa1bcc3c44f96beb3eda</code></li>
<li><code>hostmaster-0.4-rc1.tgz: b2a42b151b817c1ea6cdf15462aa2e15</code></li>
</ul>

<p>For users who have Rackspace Cloud accounts and want to install Aegir in the cloud, you are welcome to try mig5's <a href="http://github.com/mig5/frigg">Frigg script</a>, which automatically creates a new virtual server and installs Aegir, with one command!</p>

<p>For users of 0.4-beta2 and earlier, we offer an <a href="http://git.aegirproject.org/?p=provision.git;a=blob_plain;f=upgrade.sh.txt;hb=provision-0.4-rc1">upgrade.sh script</a> in Provision, which tries to automate much of the steps outlined in the <a href="http://git.aegirproject.org/?p=provision.git;a=blob_plain;f=docs/UPGRADE.txt;hb=provision-0.4-rc1">UPGRADE.txt</a>.</p>

<p>It is still imperative that you read the UPGRADE.txt and follow all version-specific upgrade instructions located at the end of the document before trying to run the upgrade script. This especially applies to users upgrading from before 0.4-alpha8, including 0.3.</p>

<p>For users coming from 0.4-beta1 or beta2, there are unlikely to be any version-specific manual steps required to upgrade to 0.4-rc1, but you should make a habit of reading them anyway just to make sure. No-one likes a nasty surprise!</p>

<p>The upgrade.sh script attempts to backup the existing backend components, download new versions, and then run the hostmaster-migrate command. It assumes you are upgrading from the previous release (hostmaster-0.4-beta2). If you are not, you may have to edit the script to change the OLD_DRUPAL_DIR variable.</p>

<h2>No Drush 4 or Drush Make 2.0?</h2>

<p>Some people might be wondering why we haven't changed the install.sh
or upgrade.sh scripts to fetch the latest Drush 4.2 release or Drush
Make 2.0.</p>

<p><em>Drush</em></p>

<p>Drush 4.2 has a bug which breaks rsync and possibly other stuff when
using multiserver.</p>

<p>It's been fixed in Drush, but we are awaiting a 4.3 release before we
roll with it. If you see 4.3 come out, you can probably upgrade your
Drush if you wish (we tested this morning and are in fact compatible

<p><em>Drush Make</em></p>

<p>Drush Make 2.0 has a bug that prevents building platforms from
distributions that didn't come from drupal.org.</p>

<p>This has also been fixed in HEAD, but we are awaiting a 2.1 release
before we roll with it. If you see 2.1 come out, you can probably
upgrade your Drush Make if you wish.</p>

you good folk sooner rather than later this time :)</p>

</ul></div><p>The Aegir team is proud to announce the second beta release of Aegir 0.4.</p>

<p>This release primarily is a bugfix release.</p>

<p>There have also been quite a few patches sitting in our issue queues for review for a very long time, and we have attempted to commit a whole bunch of those in this release. Things have been moving a bit slowly and we're sorry for that.</p>

<h2>Key changes in 0.4-beta2</h2>

<p>There are a few changes in this release that are new, such as the presence of an early 'bulk operations' feature. We do not expect this to be bug free, but hope that by committing some of this new code and making it present in a new release, we'll get some community users testing this stuff and reporting back / patching it to make it better. Otherwise this stuff just gets lost in the queue!</p>

<p>After this release we will be looking strongly at a release candidate for 0.4.</p>

<h2>Known Issues:</h2>

<p>Some of our issues from beta1 are still actually present:</p>

<ul>
<li>DNS has no access control - anybody can create any zone (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/922252">#922252</a>)</li>
<li>Inter-server migration may fail under some circumstances (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/976300">#976300</a>)</li>
<li>The site form suffers from some performance issues when you have a lot of platforms (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/955854">#955854</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, an issue has been identified with remote web servers: in some cases, when the 'master' server syncs the site contents to a remote, it can delete the files/ of a site because it doesn't sync a site's files back to the master server except in the case of backups/migrations.</p>

<p>We would like to warn users that are making use of Aegir's multiserver features to be aware of this issue: <a href="http://drupal.org/node/976300" title="http://drupal.org/node/976300">http://drupal.org/node/976300</a> .</p>

<h2>The road to 0.4 and Aegir contributors</h2>

<p>Our core dev team is small and various demands for our time have been slowing development to a degree. We have a decent-sized community with a wide range of skills, and would like to take this opportunity to encourage our users to attempt to contribute to the project where they see fit - whether this be code development (bug fixes, new features), documentation, or even promotion / talks at Drupal events.</p>

<p>We will potentially be seeking new core developers to the project soon as well. If you'd like to chat with us about contributing to Aegir, don't hesitate to <a href="http://lists.aegirproject.org/">write on the mailing lists</a> or come and see us on IRC in #aegir at irc.freenode.net. Aegir's core developers are Adrian Rossouw (Vertice), Antoine Beaupré (anarcat) and Miguel Jacq (mig5).</p>

<p>We know the barrier to entry can be a little high with hacking on Aegir, and will be refocusing our efforts to try and make that easier for new starters. An API site will be along soon!</p>

<p>For users of 0.4-beta1 and earlier, we offer an <a href="http://git.aegirproject.org/?p=provision.git;a=blob_plain;f=upgrade.sh.txt;hb=provision-0.4-beta2">upgrade.sh script</a> in Provision, which tries to automate much of the steps outlined in the <a href="http://git.aegirproject.org/?p=provision.git;a=blob_plain;f=docs/UPGRADE.txt;hb=provision-0.4-beta2">UPGRADE.txt</a>.</p>

<p>It is still imperative that you read the UPGRADE.txt and follow all version-specific upgrade instructions located at the end of the document before trying to run the upgrade script. This especially applies to users upgrading from before 0.4-alpha8, including 0.3.</p>

<p>The upgrade.sh script attempts to backup the existing backend components, download new versions, and then run the hostmaster-migrate command. It assumes you are upgrading from the previous release (hostmaster-0.4-beta1). If you are not, you may have to edit the script to change the OLD_DRUPAL_DIR variable.</p>

    </h2>
  
      <div class='node-content clear-block prose'>
      <p>After more than a year of (15!) alpha releases, we're finally out of the darkness and into the light! The Aegir project is pleased to announce the first beta of the 0.4 series. This release is primarily a bug fix release, but also new features that were the last targets for the 0.4 release goals.</p>

<p>The beta marks the beginning of the final cycle in the release of the 0.4 branch. We consider this release to be mostly feature complete. It still has bugs and problems, but since we are using it in production, we feel it's more appropriate to call it a beta, to invite wider testing and stabilise the codebase.</p>

<p>This is also an opportunity to test the upgrade path from pre alpha9 releases, which seem to be suffering from bitrot. You should be able to upgrade to this release from 0.3 and above.</p>

<h2>Key changes in 0.4-beta1</h2>

<ul>
<li>Installer now support remote db servers (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/973910">#973910</a>)</li>
<li>Some work was done to improve the usability of the hostmaster-install command, which should be usable out of the box once provision and drush are installed</li>
<li>By default, we setup local MySQL server to use sockets, which creates a separate server but improves security significantly, as we do not force people to open their database server to the network (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/977024">#977024</a>)</li>
<li>The upgrade path for pre-alpha9 releases has been fixed</li>
</ul>

<h2>Known Issues:</h2>

<p>The following are known critical issues with the current release, for which there are tickets, but we didn't feel were critical enough to prevent the beta release.</p>

<p>Some of the issues have been present since prior to alpha15, they aren't all new issues.</p>

<ul>
<li>DNS has no access control - anybody can create any zone (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/922252">#922252</a>)</li>
<li>Inter-server migration may fail under some circumstances (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/976300">#976300</a>)</li>
<li>The site form suffers from some performance issues when you have a lot of platforms (<a href="http://drupal.org/node/955854">#955854</a>))</li>
</ul>

<p>See also <a href="http://drupal.org/project/issues?text=&amp;projects=provision,+hosting,+hostslave,+eldir,+Hostmaster+(Aegir)&amp;status=Open&amp;priorities=1&amp;categories=All">the complete list of critical issues</a>.</p>

<h2>The road to 0.4</h2>

<p>We are not yet in a code freeze, as we still have critical issues opened (see below) and are aiming at a few more features to be really complete (see <a href="http://drupal.org/project/issues/search?text=&amp;projects=provision,+hosting,+hostslave,+eldir,+Hostmaster+(Aegir)&amp;assigned=&amp;submitted=&amp;participant=&amp;status[]=Open&amp;issue_tags_op=or&amp;issue_tags=aegir-0.4">all the issues tagged as aegir-0.4</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/project/issues?text=&amp;projects=provision,+hosting,+hostslave,+eldir,+Hostmaster+(Aegir)&amp;status=Open&amp;priorities=4&amp;categories=All">issues marked as 'major'</a>).</p>

<p>We also have still a lot of issues to review before our final 0.4 release. If people are interested in contributing, a good and painless way of doing so is to take issues in the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/issues?text=&amp;projects=provision,+hosting,+hostslave,+eldir,+Hostmaster+(Aegir)&amp;status=8&amp;priorities=All&amp;categories=All">needs review queue</a> and test the patches. Don't forget to change the status accordingly!</p>

<h2>Installing and upgrading:</h2>

<p>The canonical source of installation documentation is as usual the excellent <a href="http://git.aegirproject.org/?p=provision.git;a=blob_plain;f=docs/INSTALL.txt;hb=provision-0.4-beta1">INSTALL.txt</a>.</p>

<p>For the first time, we offer an <a href="http://git.aegirproject.org/?p=provision.git;a=blob_plain;f=upgrade.sh.txt;hb=provision-0.4-beta1">upgrade.sh script</a> in Provision, which tries to automate much of the steps outlined in the <a href="http://git.aegirproject.org/?p=provision.git;a=blob_plain;f=docs/UPGRADE.txt;hb=provision-0.4-beta1">UPGRADE.txt</a>.</p>

<p>It is still imperative that you read the UPGRADE.txt and follow all version-specific upgrade instructions located at the end of the document before trying to run the upgrade script. This especially applies to users upgrading from before 0.4-alpha8, including 0.3.</p>

<p>The upgrade.sh script attempts to backup the existing backend components, download new versions, and then run the hostmaster-migrate command. It assumes you are upgrading from the previous release (hostmaster-0.4-alpha15). If you are not, you may have to edit the script to change the OLD_DRUPAL_DIR variable.</p>

<p>The script is in its infancy and has not been tested except by the developer writing it. We urge caution (make backups!) but encourage feedback. If in doubt, just follow the UPGRADE.txt steps and perform all the manual commands as you usually would. Some users report problems using the script on servers with really old versions of drush_make: the script stalls after upgrading Provision. You can try to run the upgrade process manually to fix that issue, which should now be fixed in beta1.</p>

</ul></div><h1>Aegir 0.4 Alpha15 released</h1>

<p>The Aegir project is pleased to announce our 0.4 alpha 15 release. This release is primarily a bug fix release, which aims to tie off a huge amount of outstanding bugs and other tasks.</p>

<p>We did aim to release beta1 but decided that there were a few critical bugs still lingering that we wouldn't want to overshadow in such a momentous release. Instead we've chosen to push out one last alpha before (finally) heading out into beta and RC stages of the 0.4 cycle.</p>

<h2>community.aegirproject.org</h2>

<p>In our biggest news, which we've chosen to announce in this release, we are very proud and excited to announce the launch of our new community site, <a href="../../../../../index.html" title="http://community.aegirproject.org">http://community.aegirproject.org</a> !</p>

<p>Much preparation and planning has gone into building a clean, feature-rich community portal for our ever-growing Aegir users. We hope you'll agree that the documentation space, development information and community resources are long-awaited and desperately needed features to help users understand how Aegir works and how to use it.</p>

<p>The community portal features:</p>

<ul>
<li>News area (blog, announcements)</li>
<li>Almost all the Aegir documentation has been re-written and dramatically improved in a new Aegir handbook, covering all aspects of installing, using, understanding and developing Aegir.</li>
<li>Screencasts and videos from sessions and tutorials (all the historical ones have been collated and added)</li>
<li>Events calendar</li>
<li>Shop resources (to be completed)</li>
<li>Feed syndication of the Aegir universe (twitter, articles, git commits)</li>
</ul>

<p>The Documentation on groups.drupal.org is largely out of date and not in any sane order, and will be decommissioned in favour of the new documentation. Some of the still relevant and well-written documentation was dragged across and cleaned up where necessary.</p>

<p>The documentation area on the new site is still a wiki so we would like to encourage users to continue to keep them up to date and add more to help improve the experience for other users.</p>

<p>We'd like to thank all the contributors to the existing docs for their hard work and initiatives and hope you'll enjoy the new space and structure to keep helping make Aegir awesome.</p>

<h2>Key changes in 0.4-alpha15</h2>

<p>In our 0.4 alpha 15 release, these notable changes/improvements have occured:</p>

<ul>
<li>The DNS feature has been implemented and is available in /admin/hosting/features (Experimental)</li>
<li>install.sh script has been changed considerably - most of the MySQL tests and user creation have been moved into provision to be handled by drush/php. There is no longer an 'aegir_root' user required for MySQL, we simply use your MySQL root user, which must have a password. You are required to supply a valid FQDN on installation, so that remote web servers can theoretically resolve the Aegir server if connecting to it for databases.</li>
<li>upgrade.sh script added (see below, adventurous people please test)</li>
<li>UPGRADE.txt updated to be a provide a little more clarity</li>
<li>There's a new /admin/hosting/settings area with misc settings/customisations, including:

<ul>
<li>ability to run wget instead of drush cron</li>
<li>delete sites without having to disable them first</li>
<li>when selecting a core profile, hide platforms that incidentally have those core profiles but are intended as distributions (i.e OpenAtrium)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>backup task saves site's settings.php with uncloaked creds. Useful for exporting to non-aegir servers or for importing into new aegir servers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installing and upgrading:</h2>

<p>The canonical source of installation documentation is as usual the excellent <a href="http://git.aegirproject.org/?p=provision.git;a=blob_plain;f=docs/INSTALL.txt;hb=provision-0.4-alpha15">INSTALL.txt</a>.</p>

<p>It is still imperative that you read the UPGRADE.txt and follow all version-specific upgrade instructions located at the end of the document before trying to run the upgrade script. This especially applies to users upgrading from before 0.4-alpha8, including 0.3.</p>

<p>The upgrade.sh script attempts to backup the existing backend components, download new versions, and then run the hostmaster-migrate command. It assumes you are upgrading from the previous release (hostmaster-0.4-alpha14). If you are not, you may have to edit the script to change the OLD_DRUPAL_DIR variable.</p>

<h2>Known Issues:</h2>

<p>The following are known issues with the current release, for which there are tickets, but we didn't feel were critical enough to prevent another alpha release.
Some of the issues have been present since prior to alpha14, they aren't all new issues.</p>

<ul>
<li>DNS - currently there is no access control</li>
<li>Hostmaster install doesn't yet support remote db servers</li>
<li>'Save' button on forms under some versions of Firefox/Iceweasel on Linux is greyed out</li>
