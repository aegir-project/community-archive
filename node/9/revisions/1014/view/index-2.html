<p>For the same reason, Aegir doesn't support being run on a shared hosting environment where much of those low-level systems and tools are unavailable. Consult the <a href="../../../../17/index.html">System requirements</a> to ensure you meet the necessary requirements for installing Aegir.</p>

<p><strong>Warning</strong>: <em>this <span class='diff-changed'>section of the manual</span> is being re-written to bring all the documentation from the source code (INSTALL.txt and so on) directly into this manual, so those documents may change and fluctuate over time.

<p>The <span class='diff-changed'>install process can be done in one of two ways: manually and automatically. The </span><a href="../../../../399/index.html"><span class='diff-changed'>automatic install process</span></a><span class='diff-changed'> is designed for people not too familiar with the commandline</span> or <span class='diff-changed'>system administration.</span></p>

We eventually want</span> to <span class='diff-changed'>have packages</span> for <span class='diff-changed'>common platforms (.deb</span> for <span class='diff-changed'>Debian) to automate that process,</span> or <span class='diff-changed'>scripts that run</span> as <span class='diff-changed'>root for uncommon platforms for which packaging</span> is <span class='diff-changed'>impossible or too complicated (e.g. OSX).</span></em><span class='diff-changed'></span></p>
