:)<br />[22:04:45]&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;sethvincent&gt; sure.<br />[22:05:19]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;sethvincent&gt; i&#039;ll be working on the d7 port and dns.<br />[22:05:32] &lt;anarcat&gt; alright :)<br />[22:05:41]&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;anarcat&gt; and i&#039;ll be your mentor, from what i understand :)<br />[22:05:44]&nbsp; &lt;sethvincent&gt; i&#039;m a student at the evergreen state college, where i also work part time as an advisor to the student newspaper there<br />[22:06:04]&nbsp; &lt;anarcat&gt; (if anyone else wants to help with that, that would be cool, btw)<br />[22:06:36]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;shrop&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; d7 ports and dns stuff?<br />[22:06:37]&nbsp; &lt;EclipseGc&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; is the plan to move all our major components to entities?<br />[22:06:47]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;sethvincent&gt; yeah, i&#039;m excited to hear any advice y&#039;all have on the d7 port and dns<br />[22:06:52] &lt;anarcat&gt; right<br />[22:06:55]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;sethvincent&gt; entities does look like the way to go<br />[22:06:59]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;anarcat&gt; so we alraedy have a few things on the table here<br />[22:07:10]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;anarcat&gt; univate has a patch to refactor the install profile with profiler and use features more<br />[22:07:16]&nbsp; &lt;anarcat&gt; that will certainly facilitate the port<br />[22:07:30]&nbsp; &lt;anarcat&gt; that&#039;s in http://drupal.org/node/517620<br />[22:07:45] &lt;anarcat&gt; as for entities, yes, i figured that most of our current content type should probably become entities<br />[22:08:11]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;anarcat&gt; that, in turn, will facilitate implementation of the DNS frontend, which will be also based on entities<br />[22:08:21]&nbsp; &lt;anarcat&gt; and will provide a good use case for creating a new &quot;hosting&quot; content-type<br />[22:08:36] &lt;anarcat&gt; having documentation on how to actually do that while it&#039;s coded would be useful too in the manual<br />[22:08:52]&nbsp; &lt;anarcat&gt; i think that&#039;s all my brain has to offer now for that :)<br />[22:09:01]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * FatGuyLaughing has quit (Quit: FatGuyLaughing)<br />[22:09:08] &lt;anarcat&gt; sethvincent: you should get familiar with git and work on a development branch, at the very least<br />[22:09:26]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * FatGuyLaughing has joined #aegir<br />[22:09:34]&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;shrop&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; anarcat: Will there be a dev branch for d7? sorry if I missed that<br />[22:09:37]&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;anarcat&gt; or maybe work in a sandbox for the time being, not sure it&#039;s appropriate to give you full commit access from the start<br />[22:09:41]&nbsp; * FatGuyLaughing has quit (Client Quit)<br />[22:09:42]&nbsp; &lt;anarcat&gt; shrop: there will certainly be!<br />[22:09:53]&nbsp; * realityloop has joined #aegir<br />[22:09:59]&nbsp; &lt;shrop&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; cool. Just checked and didn&#039;t see it yet, but wanted to be sure.<br />[22:10:04]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;sethvincent&gt; ok. i have some git experience. i&#039;ll start out with a sandbox<br />[22:10:32]&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;anarcat&gt; cool<br />[22:10:37] &lt;omega8cc&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sethvincent: congrats!<br />[22:10:58]&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;anarcat&gt; awesome<br />[22:11:09]&nbsp; &lt;EclipseGc&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; sethvincent: be sure to let us all know where you sandbox is<br />[22:11:16] &lt;EclipseGc&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; your*<br />[22:11:29]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;sethvincent&gt; ok. what will be the best way to share things like that?<br />[22:11:34] &lt;anarcat&gt; i&#039;m sure it will be quite popular :)<br />[22:11:41]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;anarcat&gt; hum<br />[22:11:43]&nbsp; &lt;shrop&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just caught up on sethvincent&#039;s position here.. great!<br />[22:12:11]&nbsp; &lt;anarcat&gt; sethvincent: maybe here? http://community.aegirproject.org/maintainers<br />[22:12:22]&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;sethvincent&gt; anarcat: ok<br />[22:12:23]&nbsp; &lt;anarcat&gt; omega8cc: maybe you want to add pointers to your repos in there, btw<br />[22:12:43] &lt;anarcat&gt; sethvincent: otherwise, what&#039;s the next step for you and us? :)<br />[22:12:44] &lt;omega8cc&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; anarcat: right, good idea<br />[22:12:59]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;anarcat&gt; and if anyone else has anything to add to our scrum, now is a good time - we&#039;re almost done!<br />[22:13:04]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;anarcat&gt; darthsteven, you awake? :)<br />[22:14:19]&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;sethvincent&gt; anarcat: i need to study some of the general changes from d6 to d7, the aegir api, and write out a plan for the d7 port.<br />[22:15:13] &lt;sethvincent&gt; google code expects students to start coding somewhere around may 24, but i&#039;d like to do a slow start earlier than that so that by may 24 i&#039;ve already made some progress.<br />[22:15:33] &lt;anarcat&gt; i see<br />[22:15:43]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * arianekWORK has quit (Quit: Smell ya later)<br />[22:15:44]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;anarcat&gt; so between now and the 24th you start documenting a plan is that right?<br />[22:16:13]&nbsp; &lt;anarcat&gt; the right place for this is probably the handbook on the community site<br />[22:16:19]&nbsp; &lt;sethvincent&gt; yeah. a plan, studying documentation, and getting to know the mentors is what&#039;s listed on the google summer of code site, i think.<br />[22:16:20]&nbsp; &lt;sethvincent&gt; ok<br />[22:16:51]&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;anarcat&gt; i have done some of that documentation here: http://community.aegirproject.org/developing/architecture<br />[22:16:56]&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;anarcat&gt; before starting some coding, at least<br />[22:17:01]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;sethvincent&gt; ok<br />[22:17:49]&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;anarcat&gt; alright, so welcome on board again, and thanks everyone for attending our scrum session!</code></div></p></div>    </div>
