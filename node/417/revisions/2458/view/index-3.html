      <p>This is a helper file to the canonical <a href="../../../../../installing/manual/index.html">manual install process</a>. It is aimed at
helping you install Aegir on Mac OS X. Since PHP and MySQL support on OS X is fairly limited and complicated, a separate documentation page was created for that part of the documentation. You should follow this page all the way through and then proceed with the regular install, <a href="../../../../389/index.html#Stop_Now_become_the_Aegir_user">step 4: becoming the aegir user</a>.</p>

<h1 id="Special_software_requirements">1. Special software requirements</h1>

<p>While Mac OS X comes with Apache &amp; PHP (and even MySQL on the Server
version), the version of PHP shipped with 10.6 Snow Leopard is 5.3.x
and thus may not work with Aegir (as of the 0.4alpha-era) and various
other software. If you're running 10.5 Leopard, it may work out of the
box, but I haven't tested it.</p>

<p>There are several different ways to get Apache, PHP 5.2, and MySQL 5
onto a Mac OS X machine. I give detailed instructions for MacPorts
below, but if that's a bit more than you're ready to bite off right
now, feel free to use an alternative approach.</p>

<p>One such alternative is MAMP. There is a good but outdated HOWTO for
installing Aegir on Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) using MAMP located
here: <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/30270" title="http://groups.drupal.org/node/30270">http://groups.drupal.org/node/30270</a></p>

<p>MAMP stands for Mac, Apache, MySQL, and PHP and is the Mac equivalent
of "LAMP". It is a self-contained package of all of these programs
with a nice graphical installer and control panel.  You can find it
here: <a href="http://www.mamp.info/" title="http://www.mamp.info/">http://www.mamp.info/</a></p>

<p>MAMP is pretty straightforward, but it's also not very flexible
(IMHO).  While certainly not without its own headaches, MacPorts is a
decently powerful way to sanely manage a healthy stack of open source
UNIX software on your Mac. Since this is what I use, I'm going to
assume MacPorts is in use for the rest of this HINTS file. I have also
only tested this on Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard.</p>

<p>If you don't yet have MacPorts installed, go here to get it:
<a href="http://www.macports.org/install.php" title="http://www.macports.org/install.php">http://www.macports.org/install.php</a></p>

<p>Once it's installed, quit and re-launch your Terminal before
continuing.  Otherwise MacPorts won't yet be in your PATH.</p>

<p>The first two commands below are optional but recommended.</p>

<p><div class="codeblock"><code>&nbsp; sudo port selfupdate<br />&nbsp; sudo port upgrade outdated<br />&nbsp; sudo port install apache2 mysql5-server git-core unzip php52 php5-posix php5-gd php5-apc +mysql5</code></div></p>

<p>php5-apc is optional, but highly recommended as it will significantly increase
PHP performance.</p>

<p>Watch the output of the last port command carefully, as there are
usually some boring tasks for you to perform once the install is
done. You'll be wishing you were running Ubuntu/Debian and apt-get by
the time you're done.</p>

<div class="toc-back-to-top"><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></div><h1 id="Configure_system_requirements">2. Configure system requirements</h1>

<p>Next we'll create the aegir user and add it to the _www group. This
part is very different on Mac OS X than Linux or most other
Unices. Must be a NeXTism. The command we will use he is "dscl", which
is a short for Directory Service Command Line. In OSX 10.3 and
earlier, that command is "nicl" (short for Net Info Command Line). It is also
possible to create the user using the "Workgroup Manager" utility included with
OS X Server. To obtain Workgroup Manager for the OS X Client, download the
"Server Admin Tools" from Apple. For example, for Mac OS X 10.6, the admin tools
can be found at:</p>

<p><a href="http://support.apple.com/downloads/Server_Admin_Tools_10_6" title="http://support.apple.com/downloads/Server_Admin_Tools_10_6">http://support.apple.com/downloads/Server_Admin_Tools_10_6</a></p>

<p><div class="codeblock"><code>&nbsp; sudo dscl . -create /Users/aegir NFSHomeDirectory /var/aegir</code></div></p>

<p>Now you need to find the next spare UID to assign the user.</p>

<p>Here's how you find out on your system:</p>

<p><div class="codeblock"><code>&nbsp;&nbsp; sudo dsexport users.out /Local/Default dsRecTypeStandard:Users</code></div></p>

<p>Then open the file users.out in a text editor, search for the highest
5xx user ID and add 1 to it (in your brain, not in the file). So if
you find 506 but no 507, use 507. When you're done, delete users.out
to be safe.</p>

<p><div class="codeblock"><code>&nbsp;&nbsp; sudo rm users.out</code></div></p>

<p>Now assign this UID to the aegir user, replacing "5xx" with the UID.</p>

<p><div class="codeblock"><code>&nbsp;&nbsp; sudo dscl . -create /Users/aegir UniqueID 5xx</code></div></p>

<pre>
!! If you're running Mac OSX Lion, you also need to assign PrimaryGroupID to the aegir user.
   sudo dscl . -create /Users/aegir PrimaryGroupID XXX
</pre>

<p>Set a secure password for the aegir user, as it needs shell access.</p>

<p><div class="codeblock"><code>sudo passwd aegir</code></div></p>

<p>Create the aegir home directory and set its permissions.</p>

<p><div class="codeblock"><code>sudo mkdir /var/aegir<br />sudo chown aegir /var/aegir<br />sudo chgrp _www /var/aegir</code></div></p>

<p>Add the aegir user to the _www group. This is the group Apache runs as.</p>

<p><div class="codeblock"><code>sudo dscl . -append /Groups/_www GroupMembership aegir</code></div></p>

<p>Give the aegir user the ability to restart Apache.</p>

<p><div class="codeblock"><code>&nbsp;&nbsp; sudo mv /usr/sbin/apachectl /usr/sbin/apachectl-apple<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; sudo ln -s /opt/local/apache2/bin/apachectl /usr/sbin/apachectl<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; sudo visudo</code></div></p>

<p>Go to the last line of the file and add the following.</p>

<p><div class="codeblock"><code>&nbsp;&nbsp; aegir ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/apachectl</code></div></p>

<p>Save the file and exit your text editor.</p>

<p>Next configure Apache to include the Aegir config.</p>

<p><div class="codeblock"><code>&nbsp;&nbsp; echo &quot;Include /var/aegir/config/apache.conf&quot; &gt;&gt; /opt/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf</code></div></p>

<p>Configuring your MySQL database and user accounts is the same as in
the INSTALL.txt file. But you probably want to add the path to its
executables to your user's PATH and the aegir user's PATH.</p>

<p><div class="codeblock"><code>&nbsp;&nbsp; echo &#039;export PATH=/opt/local/lib/mysql5/bin:$PATH&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.profile<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; su - aegir<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Password: (the password you setup earlier)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; echo &#039;export PATH=/opt/local/lib/mysql5/bin:$PATH&#039; &gt;&gt; ~/.profile<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; exit</code></div></p><div class="toc-back-to-top"><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></div><script type="text/javascript">toc_scroll_back_to_top = 1;</script>    </div>
