[07:01:35]     scrum time!
[07:03:44]      hi
[07:04:30]     hello!
[07:04:30]     salut
[07:04:37]    hi
[07:04:37]     hello
[07:04:56]    hefring: botsnack
[07:04:56]     thanks omega8cc :)
[07:05:39]  * scientist_ has joined #aegir
[07:05:50]      I believe anarcat is on vacation, and has found his way out to the woods
[07:05:55]     mig5: scrum?
[07:06:02]      so he won't likely be joining us
[07:06:20]     I shall kick things off by saying well done to Anarcat for getting the 1.7 release done
[07:06:31]     and well done to omega8cc for getting tons of stuff into that release
[07:06:42]     that's it from me
[07:06:52]    :)
[07:07:11]    My work on porting Hostmaster BOA UI improvements to 6.x-2.x is still in progress, so I'm submitting some minor Nginx patches in the meantime. Not much to report this week.
[07:08:21]    However, I'm really tired with this bug: <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1004526" title="http://drupal.org/node/1004526">http://drupal.org/node/1004526</a>
[07:08:22]     <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1004526" title="http://drupal.org/node/1004526">http://drupal.org/node/1004526</a> =&gt; Automatic aliases are not persisted across rename and clone =&gt; Hostmaster (Aegir), Code, major, needs work, 25 comments, 3 IRC mentions
[07:08:33]     ah yes, that one
[07:08:34]    it causes tons of support requests
[07:08:44]    so I plan to attack it
[07:09:20]     ok cool
[07:09:36]    it is a major Aegir WTF/fail for most of our users
[07:11:49]  * SqyD has joined #aegir
[07:12:25]  * penyaskito has joined #aegir
[07:12:45]     indeed
[07:12:49]     anything else?
[07:12:58]    that is it from me
[07:13:09]      For my part I submitted some issues and patches to port Hostmaster to the Profiler library, making sub-profiles possible, and fairly easy. This also required a ptch to Provision to support alternative profile names.
[07:14:00]      I also depends on splitting Eldir and Hosting back out of Hostmaster for the 6.x-2.x branch, and I submitted an issue on that as well
[07:14:23]     yeah, I'm not 100% sure where I feel about a split tbh
[07:14:34]      ok
[07:15:03]     it's a good idea for us, but not sure if it will confuse people, and lead to lots of where should I post this issue type questions?
[07:15:15]     but I can see the benefits too
[07:15:21]      well, we already get lots of that
[07:15:57]      I'm pretty sure it will confise some people
[07:16:08]      but the other projects already exist
[07:16:56]     yup
[07:17:04]     anywayâ€¦anyone got anything else to add?
[07:17:18]      Beyond making hosting and eldir reusable, I think it could also make engagement in the project easier
[07:17:18]  * Artusamak_afk is now known as Artusamak
[07:18:55]     possibly
[07:18:57]      anyway, I's also been making lots of headway with Aegir-up, which now supports full development builds of Aegir, including custom (i.e. sandbox) provision repos and alternative branches
[07:19:05]     awesome
[07:19:19]     got a link for that work?
[07:19:23]      along with custom aegir.make makefiles
[07:20:07]      a bit short on docs, but <a href="http://community.openatria.com/team/node/552" title="http://community.openatria.com/team/node/552">http://community.openatria.com/team/node/552</a>
[07:20:29]      Aegir-up itself is at <a href="http://drupal.org/project/aegir-up" title="http://drupal.org/project/aegir-up">http://drupal.org/project/aegir-up</a>
[07:20:50]      that's about it from me
[07:21:13]      I have a aegir installed on two server, now when i create server content type from other to other, then aegir ui does not work anymore on other server, why?
[07:21:43]     thanks ergonlogic
[07:21:52]     i think we'll call that a scrum then
[07:22:02]     anyone care to do the logs?
[07:22:06]      I can
[07:22:20]     ergonlogic: thanks
[07:22:34]      darthsteven: can we discuss splitting hosting/eldir?
[07:22:47]     ergonlogic: sure, can you give me ten mins?
[07:22:47]      darthsteven: I'd like to make sure I understand your reservations
[07:22:52]      sure
[07:23:10]      hefring: logs
[07:23:21]      gah, what is that command again?
[07:23:27]      hefring: timestamp
[07:23:31]     hefring: log pointer?
[07:23:31]     <a href="http://hefring.mig5.net/bot/log/aegir/2012-03-12#T182454" title="http://hefring.mig5.net/bot/log/aegir/2012-03-12#T182454">http://hefring.mig5.net/bot/log/aegir/2012-03-12#T182454</a>
[07:23:42]      right... thanks
