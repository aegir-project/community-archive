08:58 &lt;@anarcat&gt; alright, so we're 1 minute away from the scrum, but i'll start anyways :P
08:59 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i'm a bit in a rush since we're going to replace a switch at the datacenter in about an hour
08:59 &lt;@mig5&gt; np
08:59 &lt;@anarcat&gt; which could affect community.a.o momentarily
08:59 &lt;@anarcat&gt; we had a few issues with the server
08:59 &lt;@anarcat&gt; it was replaced with a spare recently and we diagnosed a problem with a corrupted bios
08:59 &lt;@anarcat&gt; our hw provider is running more tests and we hope to get the original server back online shortly
09:00 &lt;@anarcat&gt; as for actual dev
09:00 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i have worked on provisionacl recently and got it in good shape
09:00 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i hope to deploy it in production here this week and get rid of our ugly sudo -u aegir kludges we were giving to workers
09:00 &lt; Aurorus&gt; sounds interesting anarcat
09:00 &lt;@anarcat&gt; so now not only can worker access modules/ files/ etc without problems, but they can run drush commands as their regular user
09:01 &lt;@anarcat&gt; *plus* this gives access to the regular drush aliases
09:01 &lt;@anarcat&gt; although there are still warnings (fixed in drush 5 and drush 4-head)
09:01 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i'm working on having site aliases respect drush -i
09:01 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i have worked a lot on the debian packages too, they are mostly ready
09:02 &lt; Aurorus&gt; anarcat: Are there plans to allow the deletion of sites and platforms that fail verify?
09:02 &lt;@anarcat&gt; provision is packaged, and there's a meta-package for hostmaster that downloads provision
09:02 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i also want to get the debian packages finished this week and we'll update the docs accordingly
09:02 &lt;@anarcat&gt; hopefully we can ship 1.0 with debian
09:02 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i started coordination of the rc3 release, but we have a significant blocker with d.o that refuses to release hostmaster
09:03 &lt;@anarcat&gt; see <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1105824" title="http://drupal.org/node/1105824">http://drupal.org/node/1105824</a>
09:03 &lt;@anarcat&gt; for the drush issues: <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1104450" title="http://drupal.org/node/1104450">http://drupal.org/node/1104450</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/node/957182" title="http://drupal.org/node/957182">http://drupal.org/node/957182</a>
09:04 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i am going to work more on security in the coming weeks, i plan to work two weeks in a retreat in the woods with internet access :)
09:04 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i will make sure we don't bootstrap evil modules so that allowing access to modules and themes is secure
09:04 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i'd like to release rc3 tomorrow
09:05 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i am thinking of starting work on the d7 port and ldap integration for 2.x during the next two weeks
09:05 &lt;@anarcat&gt; and koumbit has done its internal roadmap and we'll be working hard on 2.x for the summer
09:05 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i think that's pretty much it for me!
09:05 &lt;@mig5&gt; nice one. you have given yourself a lot of work as usual :)
09:05 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i am glad to see that crazy stuff darthsteven has been doing here :) <a href="http://www.computerminds.co.uk/articles/aegir-tasks-daemon" title="http://www.computerminds.co.uk/articles/aegir-tasks-daemon">http://www.computerminds.co.uk/articles/aegir-tasks-daemon</a>
09:05 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i think it should be merged in
09:06 &lt;@anarcat&gt; well, if anyone wants to pick up rc3 or similar things, be my guest :)
09:06 &lt;@mig5&gt; i read that: i think the queue thing would be good in aegir, hopefully doesn't have too many dependencies?
09:06 &lt;@anarcat&gt; drush especially needs a lot of love - and we'll need to work with them for aegir 2.0, which i suspect will support only drush 5 or above
09:06 &lt;@anarcat&gt; mig5: seems to be standalone contrib!
09:06 &lt;@mig5&gt; ok cool
09:06 &lt;@anarcat&gt; it's just a ghetto php daemon :)
09:06 &lt;@anarcat&gt; what Vertice didn't want :)
09:06 &lt;@mig5&gt; i thought it deopeneded on some obscure launchd-like OSX daemon
09:07 &lt;@mig5&gt; but i admit i didn't read it thoroughly
09:07 &lt;@anarcat&gt; darthsteven: recommends supervisor, but it's just to keep the php script alive - you could use whatever you want
09:07 &lt;@anarcat&gt; hey, we could even use the cronjob to restart the daemon if it fails
09:07 &lt;@mig5&gt; anyway: not much from me, as usual. i basically encountered some significant stability issues with the master branch, and fixed it as best as I could, though I worry i broke some of your ideas there. <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1106768" title="http://drupal.org/node/1106768">http://drupal.org/node/1106768</a>
09:08 &lt;@mig5&gt; i found the bug while writing my aegir build test in jenkins, which was exactly what it was designed to do (although it didn't literally fail the test :) )
09:08 &lt;@mig5&gt; and that's the other main thing i've been toying with (jenkins), although it's at an early stage in terms of aegir tests.
09:08 &lt;@anarcat&gt; cool :)
09:08 &lt;@mig5&gt; but i think we could use it more and more
09:08 &lt;@anarcat&gt; that is freakin awesome
09:08 &lt;@anarcat&gt; can you paste urls for that here?
09:08 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i'm really lazy, nevermind :)
09:09 &lt;@mig5&gt; sure <a href="http://jenkins.greenbeedigital.com.au:8080/job/aegir install/" title="http://jenkins.greenbeedigital.com.au:8080/job/aegir%20install/">http://jenkins.greenbeedigital.com.au:8080/job/aegir%20install/</a>
09:09 &lt;@mig5&gt; i'd like to at least give you or other developers access to that properly, so you can run tests
09:09 &lt;@mig5&gt; at my expense :)
09:09 &lt;@mig5&gt; as i figure you might catch migressions, and do me a favour
09:09 &lt;@mig5&gt; :)
09:10 &lt;@anarcat&gt; haha
09:10 &lt;@anarcat&gt; well, in this case the regression was mine wasn't it ;)
09:10 &lt;@mig5&gt; no matter
09:10 &lt;@mig5&gt; one other thing:
09:10 &lt;@mig5&gt; i'm less worried than you re: drupal.org's issues in releasing hostmaster
09:10 &lt;@mig5&gt; i think it would be nice
09:10 &lt;@mig5&gt; but it's not a blocker in my opinion
09:10 &lt;@anarcat&gt; ok
09:10 &lt;@mig5&gt; as our design works around it already
09:11 &lt;@anarcat&gt; ... since we depend on git
09:11 &lt;@mig5&gt; yeah
09:11 &lt;@anarcat&gt; ok
09:11 &lt;@anarcat&gt; but the release.sh doesn't know that :p
09:11 &lt;@mig5&gt; ah, true :)
09:11 &lt;@anarcat&gt; so i almost released a broken rc3 here :)
09:11 &lt;@mig5&gt; don't worry, i broke rc2
09:11 &lt;@mig5&gt; but i ignored it :)
09:11 &lt;@anarcat&gt; eh
09:11 &lt;@anarcat&gt; ok
09:12 &lt;@anarcat&gt; so if you want to break^Wrelease rc3 tomorrow, or anytime, in fact, be my guest
09:12 &lt;@mig5&gt; don't want to make more work for us in the release.sh though. but, i'm afraid i'm still crippled with a 'don't wait for drupal.org to catch up with us' mentality :)
09:12 &lt;@mig5&gt; ok
09:12 &lt;@anarcat&gt; that's alright
09:13 &lt;@anarcat&gt; alright, anyone else?
09:13 &lt;@mig5&gt; i'll have some time, this time tomorrow
09:13 &lt;@anarcat&gt; omega8cc doesn't seem to be here, so i'll talk for her a little :)
09:13 &lt;@anarcat&gt; she found a vhost injection vulnerability in the alias
09:13 &lt;@mig5&gt; oh yeah
09:13 &lt;@anarcat&gt; it was fixed in head and I *think* i merged in stable
09:13 &lt;@mig5&gt; did the security team say anything?
09:13 &lt;@anarcat&gt; which is why i wanted to make a release
09:13 &lt;@anarcat&gt; yeah
09:13 &lt;@anarcat&gt; no embargo, just release
09:14 &lt;@anarcat&gt; since it's not a stable release, it's ok
09:14 &lt;@mig5&gt; ok
09:14 &lt;@anarcat&gt; so don't tag it as a security release either, because then it gets unpublished and all the shit
09:14 &lt;@mig5&gt; she has some nginx batch updates in the queue as well, since we never really test those ourselves, we should probably just roll them in
09:15 &lt;@mig5&gt; they missed rc2 already
09:15 &lt;@mig5&gt; <a href="http://drupal.org/project/issues?text=&amp;projects=hosting%2C+provision%2C+eldir%2C+Hostmaster+%28Aegir%29&amp;status=8&amp;priorities=All&amp;categories=All" title="http://drupal.org/project/issues?text=&amp;projects=hosting%2C+provision%2C+eldir%2C+Hostmaster+%28Aegir%29&amp;status=8&amp;priorities=All&amp;categories=All">http://drupal.org/project/issues?text=&amp;projects=hosting%2C+provision%2C+...</a>
09:15 &lt;@anarcat&gt; yup
09:15 &lt;@anarcat&gt; a good review of the needs review patches would be good, but not mandatory
09:15 &lt;@anarcat&gt; too bad we got that silly security issue otherwise that would have been 1.0 :P
09:15 &lt;@mig5&gt; oh well. i admit i didn't read the security vulnerability properly. how was it exploitable?
09:15 &lt;@anarcat&gt; darthsteven: please do submit a patch for that stuff, it seems like gold
09:15 &lt;@mig5&gt; i spose i could find the ticket
09:16 &lt;@anarcat&gt; oh and i think we should fix this too: <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1108810" title="http://drupal.org/node/1108810">http://drupal.org/node/1108810</a>
09:16 &lt;@anarcat&gt; Files in sites/example.org/private are accessible.
09:16 &lt;@mig5&gt; yeah
09:16 &lt;@anarcat&gt; this is the security issue: <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1098304" title="http://drupal.org/node/1098304">http://drupal.org/node/1098304</a>
09:16 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i thought the private files was already done
09:16 &lt;@mig5&gt; i thought we could stick it in the platform vhost
09:16 &lt;@mig5&gt; the deny all
09:16 &lt;@mig5&gt; his .htaccess is probably being ignored for that reason
09:17 &lt;@mig5&gt; in that we don't have AllowOverride
09:17 &lt;@anarcat&gt; yes, the .htaccess are ignored, on purpose
09:17 &lt;@mig5&gt; yep
09:17 &lt;@anarcat&gt; okay folks, i need to go!
09:17 &lt;@mig5&gt; so i thought we could inject that into the template ourselves
09:17 &lt;@mig5&gt; sound sane?
09:17 &lt;@mig5&gt; ok
09:17 &lt;@anarcat&gt; yep
09:17 &lt;@mig5&gt; have fun with your switch
09:17 &lt;@mig5&gt; cheers
09:17 &lt;@anarcat&gt; hehe i will :)
09:17 &lt;@anarcat&gt; ciao ciao
