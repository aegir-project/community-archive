<pre><span class='diff-changed'>
Day</span> changed to Monday March 01 <span class='diff-changed'>2010
</span><sebas891> anarcat: <span class='diff-changed'>back
&lt;@anarcat></span> sebas891: <span class='diff-changed'>hello
&lt;@anarcat></span> you are <span class='diff-changed'>or..
</span><sebas891> :) I'm debugging ubuntu wifi <span class='diff-changed'>here
&lt;@anarcat> yay
</span><sebas891> ok, for aegir, I need to know how to install <span class='diff-changed'>SPIPS
</span><sebas891> kind of specs <span class='diff-changed'>?
</span><sebas891> what does SPIP need to do to Aegir in order to have Aegir install <span class='diff-changed'>it?
&lt;@anarcat> alright
</span><sebas891> you <span class='diff-changed'>see?
&lt;@anarcat></span> !pi aegir/dev talk about spip <span class='diff-changed'>integration
&lt;@anarcat> yes
</span><goumbot> kproject: owner: punched in 20280=Koumbit/Aegir::Ongoing <span class='diff-changed'>tasks/DÃ©veloppement
&lt;@anarcat></span> I can explain to you how aegir works, <span class='diff-changed'>now?
&lt;@anarcat></span> or do you understand the setup <span class='diff-changed'>well?
</span><sebas891> I'll then use these specs to make a dev (module) that will make a sort of wrapper so that it <span class='diff-changed'>works
&lt;@anarcat> hehe
&lt;@anarcat></span> It's not obvious <span class='diff-changed'>actually
</span><sebas891> anarcat: go, explain it to me a bit. <span class='diff-changed'>Please.
&lt;@anarcat></span> alright <span class='diff-changed'>then
&lt;@anarcat></span> so aegir, it's two <span class='diff-changed'>parts
&lt;@anarcat></span> the frontend and the <span class='diff-changed'>backend
</span><sebas891> <span class='diff-changed'>ok
&lt;@anarcat></span> the frontend, is more or less a normal Drupal site, which runs the 'Hosting' <span class='diff-changed'>module
&lt;@anarcat></span> The backend is mainly Drush and an extension which is called <span class='diff-changed'>Provision
&lt;@anarcat></span> That, you must be aware of <span class='diff-changed'>:)
</span><sebas891> Yes <span class='diff-changed'>:)
&lt;@anarcat></span> The general idea is that the frontend is the part that handles 'sites', 'platforms' <span class='diff-changed'>etc
&lt;@anarcat></span> that also, you <span class='diff-changed'>know
&lt;@anarcat></span> Each gizmo is represented by some nodes in the Drupal <span class='diff-changed'>(system)
&lt;@anarcat></span> it's all in the Hosting module's <span class='diff-changed'>code
&lt;@anarcat></span> that's Drupal again but <span class='diff-changed'>non-standard
&lt;@anarcat></span> when you want to do something with the nodes, you create <span class='diff-changed'>'tasks'
</span><sebas891> <span class='diff-changed'>ok
&lt;@anarcat></span> that's where it starts to get a bit <span class='diff-changed'>complicated
&lt;@anarcat></span> each frontend module (sites, platforms etc) declares some tasks that apply to its <span class='diff-changed'>context
&lt;@anarcat></span> install' type for 'site', 'verify' for platform <span class='diff-changed'>etc
:::</span> alberto56 [~alberto56@koumbit.org] has joined <span class='diff-changed'>#koumbit-ct
</span><sebas891> if I understand it right, one must register it then drush installs SPIPs before passing it to the frontend, <span class='diff-changed'>right?
&lt;@anarcat></span> I'm getting there <span class='diff-changed'>:)
&lt;@anarcat></span> the tasks are registered in the MySQL <span class='diff-changed'>DB
</span><sebas891> <span class='diff-changed'>ok
&lt;@anarcat></span> and after, the backend goes and reads the DB and calls the right provision command with <span class='diff-changed'>drush
&lt;@anarcat></span> eg drush provision-install <span class='diff-changed'>site.example.com
&lt;@anarcat></span> the arguments are passed via STDIN, in JSON, or via arguments <span class='diff-changed'>(--argument=valeur)
</span><sebas891> <span class='diff-changed'>ok
&lt;@anarcat></span> <a href="http://www.json.org/" title="http://www.json.org/">http://www.json.org/</a><span class='diff-deleted'></span><br />
&lt;@anarcat> a fairly standard javascript <span class='diff-changed'>standard
&lt;@anarcat></span> so, to do new things in aegir, there's two <span class='diff-changed'>pieces
&lt;@anarcat></span> one typically begins in the <span class='diff-changed'>backend
</span><sebas891> <span class='diff-changed'>ok
&lt;@anarcat></span> So you code in Drush in order to do <span class='diff-changed'>something
&lt;@anarcat></span> example: the provision_boost module 'modifies' the existing Verify tasks in order to configure the 'boost' module in an existing Drupal <span class='diff-changed'>site
&lt;@anarcat></span> A certain provision_civicrm module is supposed to do the same thing, soon <span class='diff-changed'>:)
&lt;@anarcat></span> after that, once you have it working well, you then code the stuff in the frontend that is going to pass the right arguments to the backend so that Drush / Provision can call it as <span class='diff-changed'>needed
</span><sebas891> <span class='diff-changed'>ok
&lt;@anarcat></span> that's the second <span class='diff-changed'>piece
&lt;@anarcat></span> you with <span class='diff-changed'>me?
</span><sebas891> so, we want a 'provision_spip' module <span class='diff-changed'>:)
&lt;@anarcat> maybe
&lt;@anarcat></span> it's there that it starts to get <span class='diff-changed'>complicated
&lt;@anarcat></span> A priori, Drush is a very Drupal-specific <span class='diff-changed'>application
&lt;@anarcat></span> You might want to avoid working with <span class='diff-changed'>Drush
&lt;@anarcat></span> Presently, the frontend is hardcoded to call drush <span class='diff-changed'>provision-$something
&lt;@anarcat></span> But there's a bug open re: changing <span class='diff-changed'>that
&lt;@anarcat></span> So that one can call any <span class='diff-changed'>command
&lt;@anarcat></span> So long as the command respects the frontend protocol, it could be <span class='diff-changed'>called
&lt;@anarcat></span> no need to be in <span class='diff-changed'>drush
&lt;@anarcat></span> evidently, passing via dursh saves a lot of trouble because there are lots of functions already <span class='diff-changed'>there
</span><sebas891> <span class='diff-changed'>ok
&lt;@anarcat></span> that's our first design decision to <span class='diff-changed'>take
&lt;@anarcat></span> drush or no <span class='diff-changed'>drush?
&lt;@anarcat></span> we can't decide this now, <span class='diff-changed'>really
</span><sebas891> <span class='diff-changed'>yeah...
&lt;@yannn> !po
</span><goumbot> kproject: yannn: punched out, worked 1h35m1s on task DÃ©veloppement id=20081 (Gestion <span class='diff-changed'>facturation)
&lt;@anarcat></span> but I think that it will be perhaps better to try to use <span class='diff-changed'>drush
</span><goumbot> kproject: yannn: worked 5h10m10s in 6 <span class='diff-changed'>punches
</span><sebas891> <span class='diff-changed'>ok
&lt;@anarcat></span> the thing is that if the installer is based on drush, it can not be returned back into the SPIP <span class='diff-changed'>community
&lt;@anarcat></span> it's <span class='diff-changed'>separate
:::</span> alberto56 [~alberto56@koumbit.org] has quit [Quit: This computer has gone to <span class='diff-changed'>sleep]
:::</span> yannn [~yannn@koumbit.org] has quit [Quit: <span class='diff-changed'>yannn]
&lt;@anarcat></span> for example, drush provision-install copies all the Drupal install.php <span class='diff-changed'>code
&lt;@anarcat></span> because install.php cannot be called via the command <span class='diff-changed'>line
&lt;@anarcat></span> in that area, d7 has come a long <span class='diff-changed'>way
&lt;@anarcat></span> And we could remove a lot of Provision code which was duplicated from <span class='diff-changed'>Drupal
&lt;@anarcat></span> that makes maintenance <span class='diff-changed'>easier
&lt;@anarcat></span> if you don't do that, you're stuck synchronising your installation code with SPIP <span class='diff-changed'>constantly
&lt;@anarcat></span> you'll always forget <span class='diff-changed'>something
&lt;@anarcat></span> If you have a separate commandline installer, it can be delivered to SPIP and they can maintain <span class='diff-changed'>it
&lt;@anarcat></span> You're just responsible for the 'glue' in <span class='diff-changed'>aegir
&lt;@anarcat></span> If you do it directly in drush, it's going to be better, but <span class='diff-changed'>harder
</span><sebas891> <span class='diff-changed'>ok
&lt;@anarcat></span> so, first <span class='diff-changed'>decision
&lt;@anarcat></span> drush or no <span class='diff-changed'>drush
&lt;@anarcat></span> the second decision, I believe, is multi-spip or <span class='diff-changed'>not
&lt;@anarcat></span> presently, Drupal is <span class='diff-changed'>multi-site
&lt;@anarcat></span> and aegir utilises that to the <span class='diff-changed'>maximum
&lt;@anarcat></span> There is the concept of the platform and the site which is very present and <span class='diff-changed'>distinct
&lt;@anarcat></span> Logically, one does it similarly with <span class='diff-changed'>SPIP
&lt;@anarcat></span> in the <span class='diff-changed'>frontend
&lt;@anarcat></span> and in the <span class='diff-changed'>backend
&lt;@anarcat></span> in the frontend, it's necessary to add a 'type' of <span class='diff-changed'>platforms
&lt;@anarcat></span> ... this brings me back to the <span class='diff-changed'>backend
&lt;@anarcat></span> In drush, there's the concept of the <span class='diff-changed'>'engine'
&lt;@anarcat></span> eg, Drupal is an 'engine' of <span class='diff-changed'>Drush
</span><sebas891> yeah.. not simple, all <span class='diff-changed'>that
&lt;@anarcat></span> ok, I have lost you here <span class='diff-changed'>:)
&lt;@anarcat></span> Let's back <span class='diff-changed'>up
&lt;@anarcat></span> Drush / drupal/ aegir are multisites, <span class='diff-changed'>presently
</span><sebas891> I see, I <span class='diff-changed'>see
</span><sebas891> yes, <span class='diff-changed'>ok
&lt;@anarcat></span> SPIP supports multisite as well, if I understand <span class='diff-changed'>well
</span><sebas891> I'm trying to think in SPIP mode, a bit, and SPIP by default, is not <span class='diff-changed'>multisite
&lt;@anarcat> yeah
</span><sebas891> Multisite is a hack, it's that that you have seen the other <span class='diff-changed'>time
&lt;@anarcat></span> Well let's put the idea that you will have SPIP 1.9.1 which will be a directory, which is going to contain many <span class='diff-changed'>sites
&lt;@anarcat></span> yes yes, but the most biggest hack, is the installer, not necessarily how it does it <span class='diff-changed'>underneath
&lt;@anarcat></span> as long as there's one database per site, that's not so <span class='diff-changed'>bad
</span><sebas891> <span class='diff-changed'>ok
&lt;@anarcat> so
&lt;@anarcat></span> you have your SPIP <span class='diff-changed'>1.9.1
&lt;@anarcat></span> your <span class='diff-changed'>code
&lt;@anarcat></span> which is a <span class='diff-changed'>'platform'
</span><sebas891> <span class='diff-changed'>ok
&lt;@anarcat></span> like how Drupal 6.15 is a platform in <span class='diff-changed'>aegir
&lt;@anarcat></span> except there, it's going to be another type of <span class='diff-changed'>platform
&lt;@anarcat></span> the concept is not very well developed in <span class='diff-changed'>aegir
&lt;@anarcat></span> it's <span class='diff-changed'>embryonic
&lt;@anarcat></span> but there is the space and the opening for <span class='diff-changed'>that
&lt;@anarcat></span> in the community I <span class='diff-changed'>mean
</span><sebas891> so, SPIP will be a type of platform, 1.9 the version of the SPIP platform <span class='diff-changed'>type
&lt;@anarcat></span> yes, that's <span class='diff-changed'>it
&lt;@anarcat></span> after that, in SPIP, I don't know how it works, but a 'site' in Drupal is a directory (sites/site.example.com/), a MySQL database, and an Apache config (more or <span class='diff-changed'>less)
</span><sebas891> how one passes from the platform to the site, that's it, the passing. How one does the <span class='diff-changed'>multi-spip
&lt;@anarcat></span> I imagine that in SPIP, that's what's similar: it's going to create a config file for the database, create a database, <span class='diff-changed'>etc
&lt;@anarcat></span> that's <span class='diff-changed'>it
&lt;@anarcat></span> so, that's something that needs knowing in <span class='diff-changed'>SPIP
&lt;@anarcat></span> Dissect the installation code to see what it does <span class='diff-changed'>exactly
</span><sebas891> yes, there are some repositories. Eg <span class='diff-changed'>/IMG
&lt;@anarcat> yeah
&lt;@anarcat></span> similar in Drupal (sites/example.com/files .../files/pictures/ ... settings.php <span class='diff-changed'>etc)
&lt;@anarcat></span> A good way to see would be to start with a naked SPIP, install a site (a multisite!) and check what's <span class='diff-changed'>changed
&lt;@anarcat></span> Both the DB file <span class='diff-changed'>(?)
&lt;@anarcat></span> after that, you can retrace the PHP code which generates these <span class='diff-changed'>gizmos
&lt;@anarcat></span> and port it in <span class='diff-changed'>Drush
&lt;@anarcat></span> ok. that's a good <span class='diff-changed'>start
&lt;@anarcat></span> the part 'port to drush' is a horrible understatement <span class='diff-changed'>:P
&lt;@anarcat></span> I think that w'ell have to go with drush to start <span class='diff-changed'>with
&lt;@anarcat></span> it will be easier for <span class='diff-changed'>aegir
&lt;@anarcat></span> so let's take that route for the first <span class='diff-changed'>decision
</span><sebas891> so, it means rewriting the multi-site code of spip in Drush <span class='diff-changed'>:)
&lt;@anarcat></span> for the multi-spip part, it's going to require searching, testing, trying perhaps to create a site in arms (?), without writing any <span class='diff-changed'>PHP
&lt;@anarcat></span> that's <span class='diff-changed'>it
&lt;@anarcat></span> after that the script in <span class='diff-changed'>Drush
&lt;@anarcat></span> ideally copying the code <span class='diff-changed'>directly
&lt;@anarcat></span> ideally, it will be an 'engine' in the Provision <span class='diff-changed'>module
&lt;@anarcat></span> I can give you a bit of <span class='diff-changed'>code
&lt;@anarcat></span> <a href="http://git.aegirproject.org/?p=provision.git;a=tree;f=platform" title="http://git.aegirproject.org/?p=provision.git;a=tree;f=platform">http://git.aegirproject.org/?p=provision.git;a=tree;f=platform</a><span class='diff-deleted'></span><br />
<sebas891> <span class='diff-changed'>ok
&lt;@anarcat></span> the platform code from the <span class='diff-changed'>backend
&lt;@anarcat></span> you see there is a 'Drupal' directory <span class='diff-changed'>there
</span><sebas891> <span class='diff-changed'>yes.
&lt;@anarcat></span> In there, there's an .inc file for each Provision command (install, verify <span class='diff-changed'>etc)
&lt;@anarcat></span> which has the specific code to install <span class='diff-changed'>Drupal
&lt;@anarcat></span> I'm checking where the engine is <span class='diff-changed'>declared
&lt;@anarcat></span> ./platform/provision_drupal.drush.inc:function provision_drupal_drush_engine_drupal() <span class='diff-changed'>{
</span><mvc> <span class='diff-changed'>!po
</span><goumbot> kproject: mvc: punched out, worked 1h59m55s on task DÃ©veloppement id=21895 (views3 <span class='diff-changed'>test)
</span><goumbot> kproject: mvc: worked 10h9m20s in 5 <span class='diff-changed'>punches
&lt;@anarcat></span> <a href="http://git.aegirproject.org/?p=provision.git;a=blob;f=platform/provision_drupal.drush.inc;h=9d37cf879bd1264fad24a7375ed9b4c94194d78d;hb=HEAD#l33" title="http://git.aegirproject.org/?p=provision.git;a=blob;f=platform/provision_drupal.drush.inc;h=9d37cf879bd1264fad24a7375ed9b4c94194d78d;hb=HEAD#l33">http://git.aegirproject.org/?p=provision.git;a=blob;f=platform/provision...</a><span class='diff-deleted'></span><br />
&lt;@anarcat> The pass will probably declare an example function <span class='diff-changed'>(?)
</span><sebas891> OK, I <span class='diff-changed'>see
&lt;@anarcat></span> make a platform/provision_spip.drush.inc <span class='diff-changed'>file
&lt;@anarcat></span> actually, it won't be directly in Provision, it'll be a contrib <span class='diff-changed'>module
&lt;@anarcat></span> but it will be <span class='diff-changed'>provision_spip.drush.inc
&lt;@anarcat></span> after that, it's there where it starts to be <span class='diff-changed'>difficult
&lt;@anarcat></span> These declarations serve just to call the right <span class='diff-changed'>engine
&lt;@anarcat></span> but at the moment all that is hardcoded in <span class='diff-changed'>provision
&lt;@anarcat></span> when you do provision-install, provision won't care that you're using <span class='diff-changed'>SPIP
&lt;@anarcat></span> It assumes that you're using <span class='diff-changed'>Drupal
&lt;@anarcat></span> so it'll do things <span class='diff-changed'>likeso
&lt;@anarcat></span>  283     drush_include_engine('drupal', <span class='diff-changed'>'clear');
&lt;@anarcat></span> au lieu de drush_include_engine($engine, <span class='diff-changed'>'clear')
&lt;@anarcat></span> worse than that, that's <span class='diff-changed'>install.inc
&lt;@anarcat></span> <a href="http://git.aegirproject.org/?p=provision.git;a=blob;f=platform/install.provision.inc" title="http://git.aegirproject.org/?p=provision.git;a=blob;f=platform/install.provision.inc">http://git.aegirproject.org/?p=provision.git;a=blob;f=platform/install.p...</a><span class='diff-deleted'></span><br />

&lt;@anarcat></span> That's got Drupal all over it <span class='diff-changed'>:)
</span><sebas891> It's very <span class='diff-changed'>Drupal
&lt;@anarcat></span> It'll be necessary to refactor this code so that it is called only if the platform is <span class='diff-changed'>'Drupal'
</span><sebas891> so, it's asking for a rewrite of the code, <span class='diff-changed'>there
&lt;@anarcat> completely
&lt;@anarcat></span> should probably fix the platform verification code (provision-verify) to detect what the correct platform is and store <span class='diff-changed'>it
</span><sebas891> that'll make the code more proper and <span class='diff-changed'>flexible
&lt;@anarcat></span> yep that's <span class='diff-changed'>it
</span><sebas891> it's no small task, all <span class='diff-changed'>that
&lt;@anarcat></span> But once it's done, it opens the door towards installing any sort of <span class='diff-changed'>platform
&lt;@anarcat></span> no, <span class='diff-changed'>indeed
&lt;@anarcat></span> but it's not so far <span class='diff-changed'>off
&lt;@anarcat></span> it's a week's work, I'd <span class='diff-changed'>say
&lt;@anarcat></span> especially since it's not in the 0.4 <span class='diff-changed'>roadmap
</span><sebas891> in Aegir, are you able to push to make it more <span class='diff-changed'>flexible?
&lt;@anarcat></span> it may be blocked a <span class='diff-changed'>bit
&lt;@anarcat></span> I think it's not in the priorities prior to the 1.0 (release), which is still not far <span class='diff-changed'>off
</span><sebas891> it's in the <span class='diff-changed'>roadmap?
&lt;@anarcat></span> well, it's the notion of 'API <span class='diff-changed'>Freeze'
&lt;@anarcat></span> because basically, that's the <span class='diff-changed'>way
&lt;@anarcat></span> all the concepts of the engines, of commands... that's the Aegir <span class='diff-changed'>API
&lt;@anarcat></span> which is really not <span class='diff-changed'>stable
&lt;@anarcat></span> it's changed completely between two <span class='diff-changed'>releases
&lt;@anarcat></span> So someone who will do a SPIP plugin will have a job to do to follow the next <span class='diff-changed'>release
&lt;@anarcat></span> I think the (current) focus on multiserver is not (a) bad <span class='diff-changed'>(thing)
&lt;@anarcat></span> it will surely be possible to do a huge cleanup after the 0.4 <span class='diff-changed'>(release)
&lt;@anarcat></span> it will be more <span class='diff-changed'>open
&lt;@anarcat></span> it'll be a bit difficult to <span class='diff-changed'>push
&lt;@anarcat></span> but I can try, if there realy are some good patches which <span class='diff-changed'>return
</span><sebas891> So, it'll happen, but not in the short <span class='diff-changed'>term
&lt;@anarcat> well..
&lt;@anarcat></span> the problem is that it there isn't interest in the community to do it <span class='diff-changed'>directly
&lt;@anarcat></span> everyone is whole-heartedly <span class='diff-changed'>Drupal
&lt;@anarcat></span> (it's not that) everyone is not against <span class='diff-changed'>it
&lt;@anarcat></span> but it's the not the actual community who's going to do the <span class='diff-changed'>job
&lt;@anarcat></span> They'll accept the <span class='diff-changed'>patches
&lt;@anarcat></span> but they're going to be very critical <span class='diff-changed'>:)
</span><sebas891> it'll take a new (?),.. with patches <span class='diff-changed'>(?)
&lt;@anarcat> yes
&lt;@anarcat></span> He must understand very well what I've explained <span class='diff-changed'>above
&lt;@anarcat></span> (he should log somewhere else besides) <span class='diff-changed'>(?)
&lt;@anarcat></span> in <span class='diff-changed'>fact
&lt;@anarcat></span> <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/aegir/roadmap" title="http://groups.drupal.org/aegir/roadmap">http://groups.drupal.org/aegir/roadmap</a><span class='diff-deleted'></span><br />
&lt;@anarcat> honestly, I don't see it arriving before 0.4 is <span class='diff-changed'>out
</span><sebas891> what's cool is that SPIP is super-stable from the side of the <span class='diff-changed'>installer
&lt;@anarcat></span> because we'll want to get a beta out for Drupalcon, in <span class='diff-changed'>April
&lt;@anarcat></span> and try to keep the code <span class='diff-changed'>stable
&lt;@anarcat></span> on the other hand, it's perfectly possible to have a parallel development branch in <span class='diff-changed'>git
&lt;@anarcat> also
&lt;@anarcat></span> one thing that is possible to do immediately, is to make a command line installer in <span class='diff-changed'>SPIP
&lt;@anarcat></span> make a clean web <span class='diff-changed'>installer
</span><sebas891> that's what I <span class='diff-changed'>thought
&lt;@anarcat></span> and it'll be just a couple PHP functions which take some <span class='diff-changed'>arguments
&lt;@anarcat></span> a CLI <span class='diff-changed'>installer
&lt;@anarcat></span> in any case, it's a big <span class='diff-changed'>job
&lt;@anarcat></span> and make it in <span class='diff-changed'>drush
&lt;@anarcat></span> in fact, I would do it in two <span class='diff-changed'>passes
&lt;@anarcat> put:
&lt;@anarcat></span> 0. test multispip in order to see how it works and successfully install a site by hand, without the web installer, just create the files and load the SQL <span class='diff-changed'>dumps
&lt;@anarcat></span> 1. code the PHP funcitons which do it, very simply, but with some <span class='diff-changed'>arguments
&lt;@anarcat></span> 2. integrate that in a Drush module, to understand how Drush <span class='diff-changed'>works
&lt;@anarcat></span> after that, we'll start speaking with <span class='diff-changed'>aegir
&lt;@anarcat></span> 3. do a code cleanup of the platform verifucation (provision-verify) in order to detect the platforms, around the <span class='diff-changed'>engines
&lt;@anarcat></span> 4. Call the right functions when a task is called, simply via the engine <span class='diff-changed'>system
&lt;@anarcat></span> 5. correct the drush module to implement the engine <span class='diff-changed'>commands
&lt;@anarcat></span> after that, do the <span class='diff-changed'>frontend
&lt;@anarcat></span> 6. add the fields in the database for the platform <span class='diff-changed'>type
&lt;@anarcat></span> 7. add the fields in the interface for choosing the platform type.. <span class='diff-changed'>etc
&lt;@anarcat></span> there you go, that's not <span class='diff-changed'>bad
</span><sebas891> <span class='diff-changed'>wow
&lt;@anarcat></span> I think that 3) to 7) won't get into Aegir before <span class='diff-changed'>April
&lt;@anarcat></span> But it's possible to do the development in parallel in <span class='diff-changed'>git
&lt;@anarcat></span> 0) to 5) are in the <span class='diff-changed'>backend
&lt;@anarcat></span> 3) to 5) in <span class='diff-changed'>provision
&lt;@anarcat></span> We should seek integration with drush <span class='diff-changed'>firstly
&lt;@anarcat></span> 6) and 7) are in the <span class='diff-changed'>frontend
&lt;@anarcat> yes
&lt;@anarcat></span> it's in order, the <span class='diff-changed'>list
</span><sebas891> yes <span class='diff-changed'>yes
&lt;@anarcat></span> <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/25841" title="http://groups.drupal.org/node/25841">http://groups.drupal.org/node/25841</a><span class='diff-deleted'></span><br />
&lt;@anarcat> <span class='diff-changed'>!snarf
</span><goumbot> groups.drupal.org: Release goals for 0.4 | <span class='diff-changed'>groups.drupal.org
&lt;@anarcat>note</span> that here, we make the choice to use drush as the <span class='diff-changed'>backend
&lt;@anarcat>And</span> thus, to not do evil with Provision to digest it (?), we want to work with something other than Drupal â€“ this is a good thing I <span class='diff-changed'>think
&lt;@anarcat>on</span> the other hand, it will also be possible to implant a backend of something other than <span class='diff-changed'>drush
&lt;@anarcat>that</span> itself is based on the JSON <span class='diff-changed'>protocol
&lt;@anarcat>This</span> time the work is done more in the <span class='diff-changed'>frontend
&lt;@anarcat>And</span> here I'm less familiar with the patent, I'm worried it's too <span class='diff-changed'>complicated
</span><sebas891> with <span class='diff-changed'>JSON?
&lt;@anarcat>yes
&lt;@anarcat>JSON</span> is the giving format that passes the information between the frontend and the <span class='diff-changed'>backend
&lt;@anarcat>eg</span> the DB passwords, the choice of the frontend user, all passed via <span class='diff-changed'>that
</span><sebas891> the Drush people, are open to do management of other CMSs? You <span class='diff-changed'>believe?
&lt;@anarcat>No,</span> I don't think <span class='diff-changed'>so
&lt;@anarcat>But</span> who cares, Provision <span class='diff-changed'>is
&lt;@anarcat>Drush</span> doesn't depend on <span class='diff-changed'>Drupal
&lt;@anarcat>That,</span> that won't <span class='diff-changed'>change
&lt;@anarcat>It's</span> very specific to <span class='diff-changed'>Drupal
&lt;@anarcat>But</span> it can roll without <span class='diff-changed'>it
</span><sebas891> The coolest thing, will be to copy as much as possible the method of Drupal installation/management <span class='diff-changed'>(?)
</span><sebas891> So that it thinks it installs Drupal :) but it's <span class='diff-changed'>SPIP
&lt;@anarcat>ok,</span> I'm going <span class='diff-changed'>home
</span><sebas891> <span class='diff-changed'>ok
</span><sebas891> thanks for the <span class='diff-changed'>session
&lt;@anarcat>what'll</span> we do with all this good <span class='diff-changed'>info
&lt;@anarcat>I</span> should translate it into English to do something good with <span class='diff-changed'>it
</span><sebas891> copy and paste it into the <span class='diff-changed'>wiki?
&lt;@anarcat>ok</span> I'll do that for the <span class='diff-changed'>moment
