20:01 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; scrum in 1 minute!
20:02 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; mig5, mvc, omega8cc, sfyn, skwashd; scrum in 1 min
20:03 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; scrum time!
20:03 &lt;+omega8cc&gt; hello!
20:03 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; scrum?
20:03 &lt; hefring&gt; scrum is Every Tuesday at 10h00 UTC: 03h00 San Francisco, USA (PST), 06h00 Montreal, Canada (EDT), 11h00 London, UK (CET), 20h00 Melbourne, Australia 
                 (EST)
20:03 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; indeed it is hefring
20:03 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; botsnack
20:03 &lt; hefring&gt; skynet thanks YOU!
20:03 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; who wants to go first?
20:04 &lt;@mig5&gt; just made it..
20:04 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; mig5: Hello!
20:04 &lt;@mig5&gt; you go firsst, you have been on fire in the queue!
20:05 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; I fixed some issues that were in the queue, and worked on the site form a little
20:05 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; Hopefully we can now handle database passwords that include special characters
20:05 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; though we may be chasing that one around a few more dark corners yet
20:06 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; I'd like some feedback about the site form changes (which are in a dev branch)
20:06 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; the issue is...
20:06 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1282280" title="http://drupal.org/node/1282280">http://drupal.org/node/1282280</a>
20:06 &lt; hefring&gt; <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1282280" title="http://drupal.org/node/1282280">http://drupal.org/node/1282280</a> =&gt; Clean up the hosting form javascript =&gt; Hostmaster (Aegir), Code, normal, needs review, 2 comments, 1 IRC mention
20:06 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; I would really appreciate some reviews of that
20:07 &lt;@mig5&gt; i never understood any of that as i don't grok javascript - i'm glad you're tackling it
20:07 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; It's basically just adding an AJAX spinner, so you know that something is happening...
20:07 &lt;@mig5&gt; so i'm not sure how helpful i can be there but hopefully others..
20:07 &lt;@mig5&gt; ah right
20:07 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; even just a test and 'I like the look of that' or 'Can we do this' would be helpful
20:08 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; Also
20:08 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; I installed Drupal 8 using Aegir last night, and it worked!
20:08 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; which isn't a major surprise, but it is fun
20:08 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; that's it from me
20:08 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; who wants to go next?
20:09 &lt;@mig5&gt; nothing from me, i see you want to add some drupal8 tests into jenkins, i can do that
20:09 &lt;@mig5&gt; still way too busy right now to look at moving tests into provision
20:09 &lt;@mig5&gt; hopefully more time early october when i go full-time consultant
20:10 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; mig5: do you have time for a quick chat after the scrum about Aegir stuff?
20:10 &lt;@mig5&gt; should do, it's either you or dinner, whatever happens first
20:10 &lt;@mig5&gt; :)
20:11 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; mig5: been thinking about the tests stuff, have some ideas and thoughts about it...
20:11 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; mig5: anything else to add?
20:11 &lt;@mig5&gt; nope, other than to say thanks to you specifically for working the issue queue like a nutter this week
20:11 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; mig5: thanks for coming to the scrum even if you don't have much to report!
20:11 &lt;@mig5&gt; keep it up but don't burn out :)
20:11 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; mig5: these are my normal levels of involvement in projects... :)
20:12 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; anyone else have anything for the scrum?
20:12 &lt;+omega8cc&gt; I don't have anything new related to the Aegir core this week to report, however I worked on some BOA new features and there is a chance I will submit some new patches for Nginx config (and finally) the menu/UI.
20:12 &lt;+omega8cc&gt; darthsteven: and also thanks for your work in the queue!
20:12 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; omega8cc: awesome!
20:13 &lt;@mig5&gt; omega8cc: i expect to hear you move into Linode Tokyo soon ;)
20:13 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; omega8cc: I think we should make tiding up the UI a priority for 2.x
20:13 &lt;@mig5&gt; sorry offtopic
20:13 &lt;@mig5&gt; apparently there was a drupal montreal on
20:13 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; anyone else?
20:13 &lt;@mig5&gt; i read some french tweets about it
20:13 &lt;@mig5&gt; something about an 'albert method', a guy from koumbit did a talk
20:14 &lt;@mig5&gt; i am keen to find out more, there are slides somewhere, search on twitter under #aegir
20:14 &lt;@mig5&gt; i think it's deployment-related, i'll see if i can find out more and get some english-language focus on it as it looked interesting
20:15 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; cool
20:15 &lt;+omega8cc&gt; <a href="http://t.co/gv7OisUe" title="http://t.co/gv7OisUe">http://t.co/gv7OisUe</a>
20:15 &lt;+omega8cc&gt; or http://twitter.com/#!/omega8cc/status/114783126844223488
20:16 &lt;@mig5&gt; oh nice already in english
20:16 &lt;+omega8cc&gt; yep
20:16 &lt;@mig5&gt; again, soon, i will have a new screencast up
20:16 &lt;@mig5&gt; about my 'zero touch' deployment for aegir
20:16 &lt;@mig5&gt; using jenkins
20:16 &lt;@mig5&gt; that 'reacts' to git push in de/v/stage/live environments
20:16 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; mig5: cool, have you seen that someone is doing screencasts of Aegir stuff?
20:16 &lt;@mig5&gt; that will come 'soon' ;)
20:16 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; mig5: that would be awesome
20:16 &lt;@mig5&gt; darthsteven: yes i did, i watched one
20:17 &lt;+omega8cc&gt; mig5: cool! finally! :)
20:17 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; mig5: I've not watched them...so I've no idea if they're any good
20:17 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; To finish the scrum, I'd like to say...
20:18 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; that we seem to have had a bump in contributors, which is really cool!
20:18 &lt;@mig5&gt; yes! rock on, patchers!
20:18 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; There are also a few people who've started using Aegir, and are now blogging about the project
20:18 &lt;@mig5&gt; thanks GuyPaddock and halcyonCorsair
20:18 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; The 'Wedful' thing springs to mind
20:19 &lt;@mig5&gt; yes and hadsie, i think that was the first commercial 'payment' aegir system that implemented our api
20:19 &lt;+omega8cc&gt; right
20:19 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; So, with a bit of effort we make Aegir 2.x happen fast, and be super awesome in every way!
20:19 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; anyway
20:19 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; that's it for this scrum!
20:19 &lt;@mig5&gt; the pantheon project is getting a lot of publicity right now, i am keen to see people publish 'how to make your own pantheon' with aegir :)
20:19 &lt;@mig5&gt; just to balance things out :)
20:19 &lt;@mig5&gt; thanks scrummers
20:19 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; Thanks for attending
20:19 &lt;+omega8cc&gt; thanks
20:19 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; who wants to do the log thing?
20:20 &lt;@mig5&gt; i can
20:20 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; thanks!
