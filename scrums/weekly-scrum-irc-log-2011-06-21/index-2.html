21:59 &lt;@anarcat&gt; hey
21:59 &lt;@anarcat&gt; gooood morning vietnam!
22:00 &lt;@mig5&gt; HELO
22:00 &lt;@anarcat&gt; alright
22:00  * anarcat SCRUM TIME!
22:00 &lt;@anarcat&gt; gosh this is early
22:00 &lt;@anarcat&gt; so welcome everyone
22:00 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; heh
22:01 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i'm your sleepy host, unless another timezone feels less jetlagged :)
22:01 &lt;@mig5&gt; getting sleepy :)
22:01 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; I'm your less sleepy host then
22:01 &lt;@anarcat&gt; yay! :)
22:01 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; Welcome to the scrum for 21 Jun 2011
22:01 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; Who wants to speak first?
22:01 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; anarcat?
22:01 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i can try! :)
22:02 &lt;@anarcat&gt; so i haven't published 1.2, but this time i have a good excuse
22:02 &lt;@anarcat&gt; we're really almost there - i want to test the debian packages first
22:02 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i was able to make an autobuilder in jenkins
22:02 &lt;@anarcat&gt; so jenkins now has a pgp key and can build packages. both from the debian branch and from the 1.x branch
22:02 &lt;@anarcat&gt; <a href="https://drupal.org/node/1183926" title="https://drupal.org/node/1183926">https://drupal.org/node/1183926</a>
22:02 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; cool
22:03 &lt;@anarcat&gt; there are a good few questions in there that i'd like feedback about
22:03 &lt;@anarcat&gt; esp. from mig5
22:03 &lt;@mig5&gt; awesome, you are now our CI ninja :)
22:03 &lt;@anarcat&gt; crap :)
22:03 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; anything else anarcat?
22:03 &lt;@anarcat&gt; well, there's this daemon thing :)
22:04 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i played with darthsteven's queue runner, and it's awesom
22:04 &lt;@anarcat&gt; we're running it in production, working very well, got people impressed
22:04 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i want to merge it in 2.x
22:04 &lt;@anarcat&gt; and port our dispatcher to the d7 queue system
22:04 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i think we should make queue-runner 1.1
22:04 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i think that's about it for me!
22:05 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; mig5?
22:05 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; (thanks anarcat)
22:05 &lt;@anarcat&gt; welcome!
22:05 &lt;@mig5&gt; nothing from me this week, i need to catch up on the jenkins changes
22:05 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; okay, cool
22:05 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; I'll go next...
22:06 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; I looked at the daemon for running tasks with anarcat
22:06 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; resulting in a 1.1 release, which anarcat hasn't noticed :)
22:06 &lt;@anarcat&gt; haha cool
22:06 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; We also got the api site sorted last week, though mostly not down to me
22:06 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; which is ace!
22:07 &lt;@mig5&gt; nice
22:07 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; I added a new hook to enable friendly names for servers in lists of servers
22:07 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; and released a module that uses the hook
22:07 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; <a href="http://drupal.org/project/hosting_server_titles" title="http://drupal.org/project/hosting_server_titles">http://drupal.org/project/hosting_server_titles</a>
22:08 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; I think I added a ton of documentation the week before too
22:08 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; which was nice
22:08 &lt; chouchou&gt; Hello,
22:08 &lt;@anarcat&gt; cool
22:08 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; but that's it from me
22:08 &lt; chouchou&gt; pls i have an issue,
22:08 &lt;@anarcat&gt; note that i documented the 2.x api changes here <a href="../../upgrading/path/index.html" title="http://community.aegirproject.org/upgrading/path">http://community.aegirproject.org/upgrading/path</a>
22:08 &lt; chouchou&gt; first, i wouuld like to know how do I change the drush gid download source ?
22:08 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; chouchou: We're in the middle of a scrum, please hold for the end, then you can ask
22:08 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i think we should keep that page in mind when we change the API
22:08 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; anyone else have anything for the scrum?
22:09 &lt;+omega8cc&gt; I finally started publishing some nginx related docs on <a href="http://www.omega8.cc/" title="www.omega8.cc">www.omega8.cc</a> and will extract from there to re-post on c.a.o handbook, also some new nginx patches are in testing and should be sumitted for review shortly, we are sponsoring also Aegir session at <a href="http://drupaldesigncamp.net/" title="http://drupaldesigncamp.net">http://drupaldesigncamp.net</a> next week!
22:09 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; awesome
22:09 &lt;@mig5&gt; props to shrop who has done great work on the community site sorting some stuff out
22:09 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; omega8cc: anything else?
22:09 &lt;@anarcat&gt; all good
22:09 &lt;+omega8cc&gt; that is it from me, i think
22:10 &lt;@anarcat&gt; ah, note that i'll be at the drush test sprint next week, so i will probably miss the scrum
22:10 &lt;@anarcat&gt; if you guys have specifics of things i should work on with drush, let me know!
22:11 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; anyone else have anything to add?
22:11 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; I'll give it a minute...
22:11 &lt;@anarcat&gt; well, i'd like to chat quickly with mig5 about the jenkins stuff
22:11 &lt;@anarcat&gt; mig5: did you read up on the issue?
22:11 &lt;@mig5&gt; this one? <a href="https://drupal.org/node/1183926" title="https://drupal.org/node/1183926">https://drupal.org/node/1183926</a>
22:12 &lt;@anarcat&gt; mig5: upy
22:12 &lt;@anarcat&gt; yup*
22:12 &lt;@anarcat&gt; basically, we need to decide this:
22:12 &lt;@anarcat&gt; 1. do we install/remove/update/whatnot on the jenkins server? (be scared)
22:12 &lt;@anarcat&gt; 2. do we install using dpkg -i or do we upload to debian.koumbit.net's unstable repository and use apt-get? (the latter has the disadvantage of having 
                 to wait a undetermined delay for repo to catchup, but has the upside of broadening the test capabilities)
22:12 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i am thinking more and more of this as a build bot, with packges uploaded to debian.koumbit.net/unstable
22:13 &lt;@anarcat&gt; and then everyone can test them, including jenkins or "the cloud", from jenkins
22:13 &lt;@mig5&gt; 1. is fine with me but i was already scared :) but as far as I can tell, it's the only way to sanely chain tasks.. (as opposed to an isolated 
              cloud-generated VPS)
22:14 &lt;@mig5&gt; the fundamental thing i want to do with theses tests, is pretend like we are a user
22:14 &lt;@anarcat&gt; well that's the thing, if we upload to debian.k.n, then we can run install/upgrade/whatever independently...
22:14 &lt;@mig5&gt; except with preseeding :)
22:14 &lt;@mig5&gt; so i think the apt-get is good
22:14 -!- bgm_ is now known as bgm
22:14 &lt;@anarcat&gt; ok
22:14 &lt;@anarcat&gt; mig5: do you know about jenkins's "tasks"?
22:14 -!- bgm [~bgm@2607:f748:1200:105::5] has quit [Changing host]
22:14 -!- bgm [~bgm@pdpc/supporter/active/bgm] has joined #aegir
22:14 &lt;@mig5&gt; no
22:14 &lt;@anarcat&gt; ok
22:14 &lt;@mig5&gt; i've only done build steps
22:15 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i tried to play with that, but i don't feel it's what we need, basically...
22:15 &lt;@anarcat&gt; it's a weird thing
22:15 &lt;@anarcat&gt; so okay, that's cool
22:15 -!- mode/#aegir [+v shrop] by ChanServ
22:15 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i think i'll try to setup fabric stuff to deploy debian packages remotely
22:15 &lt;@anarcat&gt; and of course upload to debian.k.n
22:15 &lt;@mig5&gt; deploy as in send to koumbit.d.n ?
22:15 &lt;@mig5&gt; er
22:15 &lt;@mig5&gt; ah
22:15 &lt;@anarcat&gt; and fix the preseed
22:16 &lt;@mig5&gt; so by deploy debian packages remotely you mean, build on fresh VPS?
22:16 &lt;@mig5&gt; as i am not against the former
22:16 &lt;@anarcat&gt; deploy as in ssh cloud.vps.foo 'apt-get install aegir; drush provision-tests ; apt-get remove aegir'
22:16 &lt;@mig5&gt; so long as we can clean up our mess on the jenkins server
22:17 &lt;@anarcat&gt; well, i'm worried about not being able to do that
22:17 &lt; chouchou&gt; are you free now?
22:17 &lt;@mig5&gt; my main worry about cloud.vps.foo is we may lose the ability to chain builds
22:17 &lt;@anarcat&gt; *and* about interop problems with jenkins itself
22:17 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; Anyone else have anything for the scrum? Otherwise we'll wrap it up there, and leave mig5 and anarcat to it...
22:17 &lt;@anarcat&gt; darthsteven: yup, ok
22:17 &lt;@darthsteven&gt;
