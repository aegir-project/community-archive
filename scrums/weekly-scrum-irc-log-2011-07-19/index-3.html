22:00 &lt;@anarcat&gt; alright
22:00 &lt;@anarcat&gt; scrum time!
22:00 &lt;+omega8cc&gt; oh
22:01 &lt;@mig5&gt; I didn't know if it had moved time yet or what :)
22:01 &lt;@anarcat&gt; darthsteven: scrum!
22:01 -!- Irssi: #aegir: Total of 75 nicks [4 ops, 0 halfops, 4 voices, 67 normal]
22:01 &lt;@anarcat&gt; so hi
22:01 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i am not sure what to do about the time
22:01 &lt;@anarcat&gt; steven says he can't attend every week because it's too late
22:02 &lt;@anarcat&gt; mig5: and you seem also to have issue about i
22:02 &lt;@mig5&gt; not ideal for everyone, ever.. maybe we just tolerate a 'rotation' of devs who might not always be here
22:02 &lt;@anarcat&gt; t
22:02 &lt;@mig5&gt; maybe it helps that I never have anything to add... :/
22:02 &lt;@anarcat&gt; well
22:02 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i will be on a holiday for two months
22:02 &lt;@anarcat&gt; so maybe we can flip that around somehow
22:03 &lt;@anarcat&gt; <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meetingdetails.html?year=2011&amp;month=7&amp;day=18&amp;hour=7&amp;min=0&amp;sec=0&amp;p1=165&amp;p2=136&amp;p3=152&amp;p4=137" title="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meetingdetails.html?year=2011&amp;month=7&amp;day=18&amp;hour=7&amp;min=0&amp;sec=0&amp;p1=165&amp;p2=136&amp;p3=152&amp;p4=137">http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meetingdetails.html?year=2011&amp;mont...</a> Ã‰
22:03 &lt;@anarcat&gt; ?
22:03 &lt;@anarcat&gt; 8hAM london, 5PM melbourne, midnight LA
22:04 &lt;@mig5&gt; we'll see if darthsteven complains about the early start :)
22:04 &lt;@mig5&gt; fine with me
22:04 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; Fine with me
22:04 &lt;@anarcat&gt; 2 am EDT
22:04 &lt;@anarcat&gt; anyways
22:04 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i don't know what to do
22:04 &lt;@anarcat&gt; and i wish somebody else would figure it out basically :P
22:05 &lt;+omega8cc&gt; fine with me too ^^
22:05 &lt;@mig5&gt; it won't ever work until I quit :)
22:05 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; Could we rotate early and late on alternate weeks?
22:05 &lt;@anarcat&gt; we could!
22:05 &lt;@anarcat&gt; and really, we need to keep in mind we don't absolutely need to readjust for seth
22:05 &lt;@anarcat&gt; he was pretty clear about that
22:06 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; So long as it's not too confusing
22:06 &lt;@anarcat&gt; he can (and should) provide feedback in other ways
22:06 &lt;@anarcat&gt; the 8AM is kinda hard on some people here though
22:06 &lt;@anarcat&gt; so anyways
22:07 -!- Chipie [~Chipie@mue-88-130-106-140.dsl.tropolys.de] has quit [Quit: Leaving.]
22:07 &lt;@anarcat&gt; to be clear - i would rather see both of you guys (mig5 and darthsteven) than bring seth back in the loop and loose you :P
22:07 &lt;@anarcat&gt; so i suggest we stick to the schedule at least until i leave for europe
22:07 &lt;@mig5&gt; don't worry too much
22:07 &lt;@anarcat&gt; then you guys can organize as you want
22:07 &lt;@mig5&gt; sure
22:07 &lt;@anarcat&gt; which brings me to
22:08 &lt;@anarcat&gt; somebody should probably take over gsoc mentorship while i'm gone
22:08 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i may have *some* time to followup, but really not a lot
22:08 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i'll be traveling all over the place and I won't be able to prod seth
22:08 &lt;@anarcat&gt; and he needs prodding :P
22:08 &lt;@anarcat&gt; so if somebody could take that over, that would be cool
22:09 -!- redShadow[2V] [~redShadow@93-62-151-43.ip23.fastwebnet.it] has joined #aegir
22:09 &lt;@anarcat&gt; it's just sending an email from time to time to say "hey what's up" - he's usually pretty responsive
22:09 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i tried to encourage him to document hist stuff on the commmunity site
22:09 &lt;@mig5&gt; ok. I am probably doing the least all round so I will step up
22:09 &lt;@anarcat&gt; and we reoriented his roadmap
22:09 &lt;@anarcat&gt; which he needs to document
22:09 &lt;@anarcat&gt; mig5: awesome!
22:09 &lt;@mig5&gt; if you could brief me in an email on the current status, maybe cc him
22:09 &lt;@anarcat&gt; mig5: i can forward you the relevant communications
22:09 &lt;@mig5&gt; so i'm up to date
22:09 &lt;@mig5&gt; snap
22:09 &lt;@anarcat&gt; hehe
22:09 &lt;@anarcat&gt; cool
22:09 &lt;@anarcat&gt; so that will be it
22:10 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i will probably receive the "hey you need to evaluate this guy" at the end of the program, but we'll cross that bridge when we get there
22:10 &lt;@anarcat&gt; alright
22:10 &lt;@anarcat&gt; now
22:10 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i released 1.2
22:10 &lt;@anarcat&gt; whooohooo!
22:10 &lt;@anarcat&gt; <a href="../../1/index-10.html" title="http://community.aegirproject.org/1.2">http://community.aegirproject.org/1.2</a>
22:10 -!- romaingar [5d197493@gateway/web/freenode/ip.93.25.116.147] has joined #aegir
22:10 &lt;@mig5&gt; thanks for that anarcat, it got a good response
22:10 &lt;@anarcat&gt; omega8cc found what seems to be a critical with the new cron code: <a href="https://drupal.org/node/1222208" title="https://drupal.org/node/1222208">https://drupal.org/node/1222208</a>
22:11 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i tried to roll out a patch for it and it failed to work, and i'm totally puzzled as to why
22:11 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; Cool
22:11 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i don't see the same issue at all here
22:11 &lt;@mig5&gt; i wondered if it was nginx specific, caching HTTP results
22:11 &lt;@anarcat&gt; and i'm about to give up on it for now, as we don't see the bug at koumbit
22:11 &lt;@anarcat&gt; mig5: s/was/is/
22:11 &lt;@anarcat&gt; the issue is still there
22:11 &lt;@mig5&gt; yeah.
22:11 &lt;@anarcat&gt; so i don't get it
22:11 &lt;@anarcat&gt; the original code *was* broken, but with the patch it should be fine
22:12 &lt;@anarcat&gt; <a href="http://drupalcode.org/project/hostmaster.git/commitdiff/f46c7ce" title="http://drupalcode.org/project/hostmaster.git/commitdiff/f46c7ce">http://drupalcode.org/project/hostmaster.git/commitdiff/f46c7ce</a>
22:12 &lt;@mig5&gt; it would not be the first time i've seen nginx cache a 404
22:12 &lt;+omega8cc&gt; there is no caching there
22:12 &lt;+omega8cc&gt; none
22:12 &lt;@mig5&gt; 2 days is too much though
22:12 &lt;@mig5&gt; ok
22:12 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; Not sure I have time, but will try to look if I can
22:12 &lt;+omega8cc&gt; just one 403 error locks the queue
22:13 &lt;@anarcat&gt; omega8cc: and you did try the patch?
22:13 &lt;@anarcat&gt; omega8cc: do you see this watchdog entry?         watchdog('hosting_cron', 'cron failed on site %site with error %error', array('%site' =&gt; $site-&gt;title, '%error' =&gt; $response-&gt;error), WATCHDOG_NOTICE);
22:13 &lt;+omega8cc&gt; yes, and reported failure there
22:13 &lt;@anarcat&gt; we'll need more juice to figure that one out
22:13 &lt;+omega8cc&gt; yes, it says 403, as before, for site taken offline for maintenance
22:14 &lt;+omega8cc&gt; this should be easy to reproduce
22:14 &lt;@anarcat&gt; ok
22:14 &lt;@anarcat&gt; so anyways, maybe darthsteven will look into it
22:14 &lt;@anarcat&gt; we can talk more about it after the scrum
22:14 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i monopolized the space too long :)
22:14 &lt;@anarcat&gt; otherwise yeah, release++
22:14 &lt;@anarcat&gt; the debian packages kick major asses
22:15 &lt;@anarcat&gt; and we're deploying a bunch of vservers with those
22:15 &lt;@anarcat&gt; so it's fun
22:15 &lt;@anarcat&gt; that's about it for me, anyone else?
22:15 &lt;@mig5&gt; nothing here
22:16 &lt;@anarcat&gt; darthsteven?
22:16 &lt;@anarcat&gt; oh crap, that should be a continue, not a break
22:16 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i'm on acid
22:16 &lt;@anarcat&gt; ffs
22:17 &lt;@mig5&gt; ??
22:17 &lt;@mig5&gt; ah
22:17 &lt;@anarcat&gt; anyways, i have a fix for the cron thing
22:17 &lt;@mig5&gt; haha
22:17 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; I've been on holiday, and not had time to do anything Aegir related
22:17 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; Will do something Aegir related in the next week for sure
22:17 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; Need to check up on our Drupalcon presentation with anarcat
22:18 &lt;@anarcat&gt; darthsteven: any specific time you want to do this?
22:18 &lt;+omega8cc&gt; hah, break does just that - breaks things! lol
22:18 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; anarcat: not fussy about a time
22:18 &lt;@mig5&gt; failed to fail failed :)
22:19 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; anarcat: soon though, as I think they need things from us?
22:20 &lt;@anarcat&gt; yeah, i've been kind of sloppy with this
22:20 &lt;@anarcat&gt; darthsteven: maybe we can talk later today?
22:21 &lt;@anarcat&gt; omega8cc: try cb0c2d2

22:21 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; sure, I'm around for the next 3 hours or so...
22:21 -!- scientist [~scientist@206.248.137.227] has joined #aegir
22:21 &lt;@anarcat&gt; ok
22:21 &lt;+omega8cc&gt; anarcat: sure, thanks
22:21 &lt;@anarcat&gt; i think that's it for our scrum unless somebody else wants to kick in...
22:21 &lt;@anarcat&gt; who's it?
22:22 &lt;@anarcat&gt; (who wants to upload the scrum log, that is)
22:22 &lt;@mig5&gt; i'll do it
22:22 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; I can
22:22 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; oh
22:22 &lt;+omega8cc&gt; :)
22:22 &lt;@darthsteven&gt; go for it mig5
