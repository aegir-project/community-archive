[12:00pm] anarcat scrum time!
[12:00pm] anarcat: hello people
[12:00pm] univate: hello
[12:00pm] anarcat: welcome to our morning weekly scrum
[12:00pm] omega8cc: hi
[12:00pm] anarcat: hey univate what's up
[12:00pm] anarcat: alright
[12:00pm] You left the chat by being disconnected from the server.
[12:01pm] You rejoined the room.
[12:01pm] You were granted voice by ChanServ.
[12:01pm] anarcat: univate: i don't know! 
[12:01pm] anarcat: so our gsoc student is supposed to take care of that, but i didn't get any news from him since the evaluation
[12:02pm] anarcat: which is really too bad
[12:02pm] anarcat: i'll try to ping him by email now
[12:02pm] mig5: anarcat: please send me an email before you go, re GSOC student
[12:02pm] mig5: or cc me on that one ^^
[12:02pm] anarcat: alright, i'll do this right away
[12:02pm] anarcat: other than that, i think that's it for me
[12:03pm] mig5: nothing new from me, all my time atm is taken up by work and study
[12:03pm] anarcat: alright, sounds like me except s/work and study/vacation/ 
[12:04pm] anarcat: mig5: @gmail is okay?
[12:04pm] mig5: sure
[12:04pm] omega8cc left the chat room. (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[12:04pm] You are now known as omega8cc.
[12:06pm] anarcat: okay, anyone else?
[12:06pm] anarcat: darthsteven: ping
[12:06pm] anarcat: omega8cc: how are the cron jobs?
[12:07pm] darthsteven: anarcat: pong!
[12:07pm] Irishgringo joined the chat room.
[12:07pm] anarcat: ha!
[12:07pm] anarcat: darthsteven: anything for the scrum?
[12:07pm] anarcat: darthsteven: we need to coordinate for the training and the session
[12:07pm] omega8cc: anarcat: it works great, but it should probably go in 1.3 no? as it is a critical for all users
[12:07pm] darthsteven: nothing for the scrum 
[12:07pm] anarcat: darthsteven: ok
[12:07pm] anarcat: darthsteven: i'm leaving the internets for a while on the 1st, so we would need to coordinate this week... email?
[12:08pm] anarcat: omega8cc: well, not for *all*, the drush method works fine right?
[12:08pm] darthsteven: anarcat: sure
[12:08pm] omega8cc: yeah, so it is critical in 50% 
[12:08pm] anarcat: okay
[12:08pm] anarcat: i don't think i'll be making a 1.3 release now
[12:09pm] anarcat: if someone else wants to, be my guest!
[12:09pm] omega8cc: as long as we have crush method as default, it is fine
[12:09pm] omega8cc: drush
[12:09pm] anarcat: univate: so the d7 port is handled by seth.vincent's sandboxes on drupal.org, if you want to followup on that it would be great
[12:09pm] omega8cc: uh, Lion autocorrection is crazy
[12:11pm] univate: anarcat: ok i will try and track down what is there
[12:11pm] anarcat: univate: can you give me your mail addy again
[12:14pm] univate: looks like seth.vincents last commits to his sandbox projects were 5 weeks ago
[12:15pm] anarcat: quite possible
[12:15pm] anarcat: he kinda stalled on the project at some point
[12:15pm] anarcat: i'll push him again now
[12:18pm] anarcat: so what's the next scrum time?
[12:18pm] welly left the chat room. (Quit: Textual IRC Client: <a href="http://www.textualapp.com/" title="http://www.textualapp.com/">http://www.textualapp.com/</a>)
[12:18pm] anarcat: i won't be coordinating the next ones until october 1st
[12:19pm] anarcat: so we need someone to take that over, or we suspend those for a while
[12:19pm] mig5: I don't think we agreed on a new time, i'll coordinate with darthsteven / omega8cc
[12:20pm] mig5: if we can't agree on a good time we'll suspend them or rotate people
[12:20pm] anarcat: ok
[12:20pm] mig5: or i'll move to europe 
[12:20pm] omega8cc:                          
[12:21pm] omega8cc: it should be easy to find good time for EU/AU
[12:23pm] mig5: yeah
