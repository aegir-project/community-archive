<p>The Aegir team is pleased to announce the first preview release (<em>alpha</em>) of the Aegir 2.x branch, after almost 2 years of development. We have been pretty busy with the maintenance of the 1.x branch, so development has been sometimes intermittent, but it is not over yet!</p>

<p>This release is only a first of a series of alpha releases that are tailored to make upcoming changes available to a wider audience than people ready to install from git, but also to make features more widely available and tested. More alpha releases will be published on a more regular basis in the weeks to come as more features from the <a href="../../node/1829/index.html">new provisional roadmap</a> are implemented.</p>

<p>Also, since every single attempt at providing a proper timeline for the final 2.0 release has failed miserably, we'll just stop trying our luck and just give up on a formal timeline. Instead, we'll just do the freaking work. :) Also remember that the port to Drupal 7 has been postponed to Aegir 3. Aegir 1 and 2 both support provisionning Drupal 7 sites, but the frontend is running Drupal 6. We are aiming for a "straight port" (no rewrite) of the frontend for Aegir 3.</p>

<p>See the <a href="../../2/index-14.html">release notes</a> for complete details.</p>    </div>
