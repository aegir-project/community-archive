<p>The Aegir team is pleased to announce the first release candidate for the upcoming Aegir 2.0 release.</p>

<p>This release mainly targets a few critical bugs that were found in the second beta, mostly related to ongoing Views, Drush integration and access control. We also introduce a number of new features and finally drop support for provisioning Drupal 5 sites completely (for real this time!). Along the way, we did quite a bit of API cleanup.</p>

<p>While we are in feature freeze, we have continued to add some UI improvements, since they don't affect the API. We've added some long-standing UI enhancements, and fixed a number of bugs in the views integration and other usability problems, as well as overhauling our access control. Significant improvements to the package-management system have also been introduced.</p>

<p>Our only remaining critical bugs are basically waiting on a new release of Drush, upgrade testing on Nginx and some contrib upgrade guidance documentation. If no other critical bugs are discovered during the time it takes us to fix these, we should move on to a full release of Aegir 2.0!</p>
